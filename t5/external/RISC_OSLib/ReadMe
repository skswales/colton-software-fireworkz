rlib (and VerIntern) are *pruned* copies of files from RISC_OSLib
from RISC OS Open.

To create, first acquire a RISC OS CVS client.

Run rlib_cvs_co to checkout the apache/RiscOS/Sources/Lib/RISC_OSLib/rlib
module.

Run rlib_prune to copy just the files that Fireworkz needs to use.

NB VerIntern is just placed at this level, one up from normal, to
simplify Fireworkz' include path

Once you've done that you may wish to move the 'apache' directory to some
reference location to save space & speed find results
