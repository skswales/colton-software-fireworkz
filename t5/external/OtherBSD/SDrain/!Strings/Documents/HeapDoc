HeapLib

A library to manage a heap above HIMEM

FN_DIM : one function to control it all!

new_addr%=FN_DIM(old_addr%,new_size%)

The heap is created automatically.
The heap and wimpslot expand and contract for the current contents.
If old_addr%=0 then a new block is allocated.
If new_size%=0 then the block is released, and it returns TRUE/-1.
If the operation was not successful it returns FALSE/0
The block address may change when re-sizing.
