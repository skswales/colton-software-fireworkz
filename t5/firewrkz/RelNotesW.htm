    <h2 id="ReleaseHistory">Release History</h2>

    <p>
        The full release history may be found <a href="https://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/fireworkz/release_history/">online</a>;
        just the last few revisions of Fireworkz are documented here.
    </p>

    <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/fireworkz/addenda_and_errata/">Addenda and Errata</a> for details of changes to functionality.</p>


    <h3>2.32 (05 Nov 2022)</h3>

    <p>More consistent use of https:// vs. http:// in URLs.</p>

    <p>Much missing spreadsheet function documentation now provided.</p>

    <p>
        Pressing Ctrl whilst clicking the Up icon in dialogue boxes may be
        used to set the value in the adjacent field to its maximum allowed value.
        Similarly, Ctrl-Down may be used to set the minimum allowed value.
        Ctrl-Up/Down arrow keys work in the same way.
    </p>

    <p>Improve detection of not-specifically-typed tab- and comma-separated-value files.</p>

    <p>Windows: Can import tab-separated-value (TSV) files of extension .tsv, analagous to importing CSV files.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed issue where Fireworkz could abort during Quit if data had been copied to the Windows clipboard.</p>


    <h3>2.31 (10 Sep 2021)</h3>

    <p>The VALUE() spreadsheet function will also attempt to recognise date values, and numbers with currency and thousands separator characters.</p>

    <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/fireworkz/addenda_and_errata/">Addenda and Errata</a> for details.</p>

    <p>Complex number spreadsheet function argument validation improved.</p>


    <h3>2.30.03 (31 Aug 2021)</h3>

    <p>Windows: Fixed the URL to the <em>Getting Started Guide</em> in these notes.</p>

    <p>Windows: Save As dialogue box now works again in release build.</p>

    <p>Windows: Microsoft Structured Storage API is used to write compound document data (for Save As Excel).</p>


    <h3>2.30.02 (30 Aug 2021)</h3>

    <p>Much faster M_DETERM() and M_INVERSE() with large matrices.</p>

    <p>No longer trims leading blank columns and rows when importing Microsoft Excel worksheets.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed size of Microsoft Excel BIFF BLANK record written (would have caused modern Excel file validation to winge).</p>


    <h3>2.30 (10 Nov 2020)</h3>

    <p>The Save as template command has been moved into the new Save as sub-menu.</p>

    <p>The Export menu option has been transformed into an Export sub-menu, explicity listing the available formats.</p>

    <p>The Export as Drawfile command has been moved into the new Export sub-menu.</p>

    <p>The style that is created and applied to tables that are inserted into Letter-based documents now contains Heading x# so that cell references make sense.</p>

    <p>CSV import as table and Microsoft Excel import attempt to add a BaseTable style area if said style exists (Insert Table already does this).</p>

    <p>
        If style elements that are normally added to a table area on insertion (paragraphs margins, grid style)
        are present in an added BaseTable style, they are no longer added.
        Separate column width regions are still added to table columns.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is now a Go to command (F5).
        A dialogue box will appear in which you can specify where you want to go to.<br>
        You can type a cell reference here or specify a named cell (or range).<br>
        If you type a number, it will be interpreted as a row number.
        The current cell will stay in the same column as before, but move to the specified row.
        If you type plus (or minus) before the number, it will be interpreted as a row offet.
        The current cell will move down (or up) by that number of rows.<br>
        If you type one or more letters, it will be interpreted as a column specifier.
        The current cell will stay on the same row as before, but move to the specified column.
        If you type C followed by plus (or minus) then a number, it will be interpreted as a column offet.
        The current cell will move right (or left) by that number of columns.
    </p>

    <p>
        Autoformat is no longer applied to numeric data typed in without any additional format characters,
        so the resulting cell will be displayed using an existing base or cell style.
    </p>

    <p>The Auto Sum button has been changed to popup a short menu of useful aggregate functions.</p>

    <p>The Auto Sum button now fills in the bottom right cell (being the sum of the sums of each row) if both the bottom row and rightmost column of the selection are empty.</p>

    <p>The MATCH() spreadsheet function now behaves as documented, returning a cell reference when successfully searching a range (this had always been broken in Fireworkz and Resultz).</p>

    <p>The DOLLAR() spreadsheet function now formats negative numbers in parentheses.</p>

    <p>The first button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is mandatory; if it is empty, the button is labelled "OK".</p>

    <p>The second button to the ALERT() and INPUT() spreadsheet functions is optional; if it is present, but empty, the button is labelled "Cancel".</p>

    <p>The JOIN() and REPT() spreadsheet functions now check for 32-bit overflow when calculating how much space to allocate for the result text string.</p>

    <p>Empty arrays returned from spreadsheet functions now reliably render as blank.</p>

    <p>The Edit &ndash; Chart dialogue box for bar and line charts now displays a sensible caption when a non-axis or non-series chart item is selected.</p>

    <p>Failed loading of malformed documents no longer leaves null events running continually.</p>

    <p>Faint grid now renders correctly again (broken in 2.10.01).</p>

    <p>The C library's complex number functions are used where possible in the complex number spreadsheet functions rather than our own implementation of these.</p>

    <p>RTF import: trailing space after an escaped hex character is no longer consumed.</p>

    <p>RTF import: default \uc value is one.</p>

    <p>RTF import: now handles surrogate pairs for non-BMP UNICODE characters.</p>

    <p>RTF export: non-BMP UNICODE characters are now saved as a surrogate pair.</p>

    <p>Fixes for Microsoft Excel import where the Excel "General" cell style is applied.</p>

    <p>Added Microsoft Word / LibreOffice-compatible keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-L/E/R/J for Justify Left/Centre/Right/Full.</p>

    <p>If a document only has a single page, only that single page number is displayed in the Print (Extra) dialogue box.</p>

    <p>When saving a document that uses a CurrentCell style, an associated redundant implied region is no longer saved.</p>

    <p>The Save as template dialogue box presents the Style list using a drop-down menu for compactness.</p>

    <p>Scaling removed from the View control dialogue box to a separate View scale dialogue box.</p>

    <p>More numeric formats are presented in the Style &ndash; Numbers drop-down menu.</p>

    <p>
        Uses 32-bit to 64-bit intermediate calculation for spreadsheet
        integer addition/subtraction/multiplication where necessary
        so that potential overflow checks with larger integers
        don't force calculations to be done in floating point.
    </p>

    <p>Reject plus and minus in dialogue box writable fields which have an integer minimum value greater than or equal to zero.</p>

    <p>The function selector dialogue box now shows all optional parameters for each spreadsheet function, not just the first one.</p>

    <p>Use standard OK and Cancel button placement for Backdrop dialogue box.</p>

    <p>
        Attempting to load a document which is already loaded no longer stops with an error.
        On Windows, this allows a multiple file selection which contains an already-loaded document to be loaded from the File Open dialogue box without stopping on that error.
    </p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed error messages from printing system.</p>

    <p>
        Windows: Length of text passed to individual ExtTextOut() calls is now limited (to 3.5K characters).
        This avoids silent error returns and associated rendering failures when very long spreadsheet text strings are generated.
    </p>

    <p>Windows: Updated HLP file.</p>

    <p>Windows: Ctrl-Mouse wheel now zooms in/out like other programs, rather than the reverse.</p>

    <p>Windows: Ctrl-Mouse wheel now zooms in/out to a set of useful preset values, rather than in tiny increments.</p>

    <p>Windows: Ctrl-click on the 'Spectacles' icon opens the View Scale dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Windows: Ctrl-click on the 'New' icon opens the Insert File dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Windows: Ctrl-click on the Cut icon performs the Delete selection command (i.e. does not copy the selection to the clipboard).</p>

    <p>Windows: You can now Ctrl-click the Sum toolbar button to access the short functions list.</p>

    <p>Windows: Style dialogue boxes no longer drift towards the top left of the window.</p>

    <p>Windows: Dialogue box placement improved.</p>

    <p>Windows: OK button (and other default action buttons) placed to the left of the Cancel button in dialogue boxes to conform to current Windows Style Guidelines.</p>

    <p>Windows: Return can be used in multi-line edit controls in dialogue boxes.</p>

    <p>Windows: Removed Ctrl-Shift-N shortcut for File &ndash; New; it was already Ctrl-N on the menu.</p>

    <p>Windows: Drawfile option added to the main Save As dialogue box. Export as Drawfile command removed from File menu.</p>

    <p>Windows: Save As dialogue box extended to support Selection option.</p>

    <p>Windows: Save As dialogue box extended to support Pages option for saving as Hybrid Draw or as Drawfile.</p>

    <p>Windows: Spaces in the leafname of a loaded Microsoft Excel spreadsheet are converted to underscore for consistency with those in the worksheet name to help RISC OS interoperability.</p>
    
    <p>Windows: Handle multi-line toolbar tooltip messages.</p>

    <p>Windows: Handle toolbar tooltip messages longer than 80 characters.</p>

    <p>Windows: Some improvements to 32-bpp high-DPI toolbar icons.</p>

    <p>Windows: Standard release build is now done on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2019 with the v141_xp platform toolset.</p>

    <p>Windows: Use std::mt19937_64 (Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator of 64-bit numbers) engine in random number generator code rather than imported one.</p>


    <h3>2.24.07 (05 May 2020)</h3>

    <p>Windows: Menu code no longer uses strncmp() routine that uses enhanced CPU instructions in 32-bit build. Allows use on older (Pentium-class) systems.</p>


    <h3>2.24.06 (28 Apr 2020)</h3>

    <p>Fixed an unitialised memory issue that caused problems when loading documents containing custom functions.</p>

    <h3>2.24.04 (11 Apr 2020)</h3>

    <p>Windows: No longer uses enhanced CPU instructions in 32-bit build. Allows use on older (Pentium-class) systems.</p>


    <h3>2.24.03 (01 Apr 2020)</h3>

    <p>The DAYNAME() and WEEKDAY() spreadsheet functions may now take a mode parameter to control the calculation.</p>

    <p>The DDB() spreadsheet function may now use a non-integer period for calculation.</p>

    <p>The TRIM() and VALUE() spreadsheet functions can accept text strings longer than 200 characters as input.</p>


    <h3>2.23 (not released)</h3>

    <p>
        'What happened to this release?' I hear you ask.
        This was used for developing new features and bug fixes,
        many of the former of which made it into 2.24,
        with some of the latter being backported to (bug fix build) 2.22.01.
        A number of people used copies of development builds
        that described themselves as 2.23 variants
        in order to test some of these new features and for checking bug fixes,
        so this version number was best left unused for actual releases.
    </p>


    <h3>2.22.01 (24 Dec 2019)</h3>

    <p>
        Formatting a very large number with a small radix
        (either with Style or the TEXT() spreadsheet function)
        no longer overflows temporary buffer causing subsequent error.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed the DAYS_360() spreadsheet function (had inadvertently been forcing European method).</p>

    <p>Fixed the SUM_X2PY2() spreadsheet function.</p>

    <p>Fixed memory leak when closing spreadsheet documents.</p>

    <p>Fixed inserting of names that are defined as cell references into text cells.</p>

    <p>Allow inserting of names that are defined as ranges into text cells. Only the top left cell value is used</p>

    <p>
        Attempts to autoformat numeric data typed on the formula editing line (as occurs with Edit in Cell).
        e.g. &pound;1,234 will be recognised as a number and formatted with currency symbol and thousands separator.
        Any text starting with an equals sign will not be autoformatted but parsed as a formula as before.
    </p>

    <p>Any error when loading a template for a foreign file is now referred to using the template filename, not the foreign filename.</p>

    <p>RowTable construct only saved in document when different to default (zero).</p>

    <p>
        PipeDream charts saved in either the new (0xA77) or the old (0xDDE) file type
        are recognised as Draw files and may be inserted into documents.
    </p>

    <p>Uses C library's inverse hyperbolic functions rather than own implementation.</p>

    <p>Checks for integer overflow when adding to/subtracting from date/time components.</p>

    <p>
        Checks for attempt to divide by a denormalised (i.e. very very small) number;
        this would previously have given FP error rather than Divide by zero error.
    </p>

    <p>Checks for rejection of non-numeric values in SPEARMAN() spreadsheet function improved.</p>

    <p>
        The Boolean spreadsheet functions and operators (such as AND() and &amp;)
        would previously have given a 'Parameter out of range' error when passed large numbers
        that were not representable in the largest (32-bit) integer type used internally,
        rather than just checking whether the number was zero (false) or non-zero (true).
        This also applies to Boolean values used in custom function control statements (IF/ELSEIF/WHILE/UNTIL)
    </p>

    <p>
        Numbers may now be formatted using a date format in the Numbers style section.
        If a date format is detected in that section, numbers are treated as
        Microsoft Excel-compatible serial numbers and converted to dates for formatting.
        This can help with importing files from Microsoft Excel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Formatting now imported better from Microsoft Excel BIFF3 files.
        This allows dates and/or times to be correctly detected.
    </p>

    <p>Increased accuracy of numbers loaded from Microsoft Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 files.</p>

    <p>Windows: Some spreadsheet function status line help was not correctly encoded and appeared garbled.</p>

        dragging to the application icon (RISC OS) or from the Open dialogue box (Windows)
        to load supporting documents (e.g. custom functions or referenced data).
        This is achieved by renaming the newly created document after loading,
        rather than creating a new untitled document and loading the template into that,
        as remains the case when creating documents from the application icon (RISC OS) or from the New dialogue box (Windows).

    <p>The COUNTBLANK function has been recategorised as a statistical function (like COUNTA).</p>

    <p>
        When saving a selection as Text that is just a fragment (i.e. not containing any whole cells),
        no terminating newline is appended.
        This is particularly useful when transferring text to other consumers via the clipboard.

        For spreadsheets, this is usually best set in <code>BaseSheet</code>.
    </p>


    <h3>2.10 (24 Jun 2016)</h3>

    <h4>Date spreadsheet functions added:</h4>

    <p>
        EDATE(),<br>
        EOMONTH().
    </p>

    <p>
        Spreadsheet functions that take date parameters have been extended to accept numeric input.
        If a number is supplied where a date is required, it is treated as an OpenDocument / Microsoft Excel-compatible serial number and converted to a date value.
        This allows data sets containing such numeric values to be more easily processed in Fireworkz.
    </p>

    <p>Read-only files are locked against editing; to edit a read-only file it must first be saved with a different file name.</p>

    <p>The 3-D chart terms roll and pitch have been replaced by the terms turn and droop that better describe their actions (chart turns about y-axis, floor of chart droops forwards from the x-axis).</p>

    <p>Polygonal Draw paths in charts are now closed correctly.</p>

    <p>
        Non-rectangular quadrilateral Draw paths in charts use rounded joints.
        This avoids mitred joints of non-Thin lines poking well beyond 3-D bars.
    </p>

    <p>Greatly improved click selection of objects in charts; more refined tests are applied if the simple object bounding box is hit.</p>

    <p>JPEG files inserted into charts now render correctly.</p>

    <p>Resizing charts and pictures shows the zoom factor being applied.</p>

    <p>Supports loading of Poster and Vector (RISC OS) image files.</p>

    <p>ImageFileEmbedded construct added to handle loading/saving non-native / original format image files in addition to a more portable Draw file representation.</p>

    <p>Fixes for note unpinning / repinning.</p>

    <p>Fixes for note saving - compatibility for older readers.</p>

    <p>Note saving - where the original image file data is available (and is of type other than Draw file) this will be listed as the default option.</p>

    <p>Fix where inserting multiple copies of the same referenced picture could lead to them not being displayed until the document was reloaded.</p>

    <p>Styles that are only used in Upper regions (i.e. ones that are not printed, e.g. Current cell) are not used to populate the style in the Effects dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Improved sizing and alignment of UI elements in several dialogue boxes.</p>

    <p>Several OK buttons in dialogue boxes replaced with Insert buttons (e.g. for Insert field).</p>

    <p>Any errors when saving a user's Choices file will now delete that file: this avoids malformed Choices files preventing startup.</p>

    <p>Removed support for ancient 'Integrale' format spell check dictionaries.</p>

    <p>Template Text and Number styles updated to have an appropriate New Object attribute.</p>

    <p>Templates now use separate Header and Footer styles rather than a combined BaseHeadFoot style.</p>

    <p>Windows: File Open dialogue box may be used to open multiple files at once; use Ctrl-click to select more than one file.</p>

    <p>Windows: Open as read-only option is now present in File Open dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Windows: Dialogue box captions are Appropriately Capitalised.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed bug which always mapped Ctrl-clicks and Shift-clicks as right mouse clicks; these are mapped as required in each context.</p>

    <p>Windows: Right mouse button clicks on toolbar buttons are ignored (there are no context menus).</p>

    <p>Windows: More attractive 32-bit toolbar buttons with alpha channel are used on high-colour displays when themes are active.</p>

    <p>Windows: Toolbar buttons are rendered using current theme if possible. Disabled toolbar buttons are rendered dimmed using alpha blending. When themes are active, the theme separator is rendered rather than just leaving the space blank.</p>

    <p>Windows: Dialogue box owner-draw buttons are rendered using current theme if possible; if not, they are always framed using DrawFrameControl (previously the frame could disappear leading to confusion).</p>

    <p>Windows: Dialogue box owner-draw buttons are slightly larger than before.</p>

    <p>Windows: Colour dialogue box custom colours are initially populated with RISC OS Window Manager sixteen default colours for convenience.</p>

    <p>Windows: Dictionary dialogue box list was too large and had internal scroll bar.</p>

    <p>Windows: As JPEG files inserted into Drawfiles do not render on Windows, when you insert them into charts on Windows they are first transformed to Windows BMP.</p>

    <p>Windows: Uses GDI+ to handle a much wider range of image file formats.</p>

    <p>Windows: Windows 2000 Professional is no longer supported.</p>

    <p>Fix for inline sequence size change perturbing style applications.</p>

    <p><strong>This is a critical backwards compatibility fix for all users.</strong></p>

    <p>Any documents created or modified in 2.00.00 or 2.00.01 that contain text with style/effect applications to the right of inline sequences (e.g. Insert date, Tab, Unicode) may need to have bits of style edited off with the region editor or reapplied.</p>


    <h3>2.00.01 (05 Nov 2015)</h3>

    <p>Fixed another error in null event handling for row formatting.</p>


    <h3>2.00 (20 Oct 2015)</h3>

    <h3>New spreadsheet functions</h3>

    <p>A large number of spreadsheet functions have been implemented in Fireworkz to assist Microsoft Excel file loading, most of which are useful additions in any case.</p>

    <p>
        For details about any of the newly added spreadsheet functions, please see the <a href="https://croftnuisk.co.uk/coltsoft/fireworkz/addenda_and_errata/">Addenda and Errata</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wherever possible, these new spreadsheet function names are
        compatible with the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) 1.2 standard (ODF)
        and Microsoft Excel 2013 to allow for easy future disambiguation.
        Loading formulae from (and saving them to) Excel BIFF files translates
        from (and to) the appropriate BIFF function number automatically.
        Note that some of the newest functions do not have BIFF function number equivalents.
    </p>

    <p>A number of these new functions require underscores in Fireworkz to disambiguate them from cell references (e.g. DAYS_360(), SUM_X2MY2()).</p>

    <p>M_UNIT() has an underscore for consistency with other Fireworkz matrix functions.</p>

        N(),<br>
        SUBSTITUTE(),<br>
        T().
    </p>

    <h4>Implementation notes</h4>

    <p>
        FORECAST(), INTERCEPT(), PEARSON(), RSQ(), SLOPE(), STEYX()
        are implemented using a two-pass approach, first independently computing the mean values,
        then computing intermediate values (such as the sum of the squares, products) using the
        difference between each value and the corresponding mean value.
        This approach helps avoid many round-off errors and is also employed by Microsoft Excel 2003 and later.
    </p>

    <p>AVEDEV(), COVARIANCE.P(), COVARIANCE.S(), CORREL(), KURT(), SKEW(), SKEW.P() are also calculated using this two-pass approach.</p>

    <p>DEVSQ() is calculated using a one-pass 'calculator' approach using sum-of-squares and square-of-sums as with VAR() etc.</p>


    <h3>Spreadsheet enhancements</h3>

    <p>AVG(), MAX() and MIN() spreadsheet functions may now be applied to ranges of date / time values.</p>

    <p>BIN() spreadsheet function has always taken an arbitrary dimensioned array or range of data as its first parameter. Previously only the first column of this data would have been binned; now all the supplied data is binned.</p>

    <p>CHAR() spreadsheet function no longer allows Fireworkz' internal inline escape character (ASCII 21) to be inserted into a string (would subsequently crash the text formatter).</p>

    <p>COMBIN() & PERMUT() spreadsheet functions have improved accuracy for large parameters.</p>

    <p>
        Complex number functions now accept ODF/Microsoft Excel-style
        complex number strings (e.g. "2+1i", "1", "-j") as well as 2x1 arrays of numbers.
        The acceptable imaginary numbers suffix is either lower-case i or j,
        and where a function takes a pair of complex numbers and an imaginary number suffix is specified on both numbers,
        both numbers need not use the same suffix (Microsoft Excel would require both to be the same) and 'i' will dominate.
    </p>

    <p>Complex number functions reclassified as Engineering functions to assist new users transitioning from other software.</p>

    <p>
        DDB() spreadsheet function accepts an extra parameter, <em>factor</em> (optional).
    </p>

    <p>FORMULA_TEXT() spreadsheet function will now decode referenced formula as it would appear on the formula line (would have differed with alternate SSContext).</p>

    <p>GRAND() spreadsheet function will now recalculate automatically on reload.</p>

    <p>HLOOKUP() / VLOOKUP() spreadsheet functions will now reject negative offset parameters as intended.</p>

    <p>
        INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the column and/or row number.<br>
        If the column number is zero, the whole of the specified row(s) is returned.<br>
        If the row number is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) is returned.
    </p>

    <p>
        INDEX() spreadsheet function will now accept zero for the optional column and/or row size.<br>
        If the column size is zero, the rest of the specified row(s) beginning at the given column number is returned.<br>
        If the row size is zero, the whole of the specified column(s) beginning at the given row number is returned.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the <em>length</em> parameter is omitted for LEFT() or RIGHT() spreadsheet functions, a <em>length</em> of one is assumed.
        A <em>length</em> of zero is now allowed (consistency with MID()).
    </p>

    <p>
        INT() spreadsheet function extended to return an OpenDocument / Microsoft Excel-compatible serial number
        when passed <em>date</em> parameter. Prevously this would have yielded an error.
        Given that Microsoft Excel incorrectly believes 1900 to be a leap year,
        the conversion is performed such that all dates starting from 01-Mar-1900 yield the same number as Microsoft Excel.
        Fireworkz can also yield serial numbers for dates before 1900, unlike Microsoft Excel.
    </p>

    <p>INT() spreadsheet function returns zero when passed time-only values.</p>

    <p>IRR() converges much faster (had poor initial condition).</p>

    <p>
        MEDIAN() spreadsheet function now accepts a list of parameters (used to be restricted to a single array parameter)
        and is now interruptible whilst processing very large data sets.
    </p>

    <p>REPT() spreadsheet function now yields an empty string when a repeat count of zero is specified.</p>

    <p>SORT() spreadsheet function now sorts on the correct (one-based) column number.</p>

    <p>STD(), STDP(), VAR(), VARP() (and their database equivalents) spreadsheet functions are now more stable with large numeric inputs.</p>

    <p>TIMEVALUE() spreadsheet function extended to accept a date as well as a time, rather than giving an error.</p>

    <p>Date/time values may now have fractional values added and subtracted from them.</p>

    <p>Improved handling of date/time values with just either date or time component.</p>

    <p>
        Evaluator coercion of real numbers to (non-custom) spreadsheet functions which
        require integer parameters now applies the same rounding as ODF.INT() to improve accuracy.
        This is similar rounding (around the 14th significant place) as applied to INT() in 1.30/05
        such that formulae which are affected by the imprecise floating point representation of
        fractional numbers e.g. INT((0.06-0.02)/2E-6) yield the correct integer value.
        Note that all such extra rounding in the evaluator, inlcuding that applied by INT(),
        may be completely suppressed by deselecting the option in the Choices dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>Spreadsheet names (and custom function parameters) may now begin with an underscore for improved Microsoft Excel file compatibility.</p>

    <p>Formulae in Fireworkz files are scanned and pre-processed as necessary to prune user Library prefixes that are known to be present in existing documents so that custom function references are made more portable across platforms and Fireworkz versions.</p>

    <p>Range recognition in formulae now looks for any optional separator colon in the correct place if two external references are given e.g. [Sheet1]A1:[Sheet1]B5.</p>

    <h4>Formatting</h4>

    <p>Date/time and number formatting now better respects the precision as given by the field character count.</p>

    <p>Date format extended to accept five 'm' or 'M' characters to yield first character of month name.</p>

    <p>Number formats may now include simple colours (in square brackets) from the set White, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black.</p>

    <p>Number format extended to accept '?' characters (these act as underscore in Fireworkz formats).</p>


    <h3>User interface enhancements</h3>

    <h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>

    <p>Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut added to select whole document / header / footer.</p>

    <p>Insert file modification time (Ctrl+T) and Insert time (Ctrl+Shift+T) commands added.</p>

    <p>Insert Row / Delete Row operations changed from F7 & F8 to Ctrl+F7 & Ctrl+F8 to avoid unfortunate clash with the expected Undo function on RISC OS. These may be changed back trivially by editing the Config file to remove the '^' prefixes.</p>

    <p>
        Windows: Ctrl+K is no longer mapped to the Spell check menu entry (consistency with RISC OS key mapping).
    </p>

    <h4>Menus</h4>

    <p>Edit &ndash; Change case sub-menu has UPPER-CASE, lower-case, Initial Caps and Swap Case entries. These replace the Case dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Inserts sub-menu moved from the Extra menu to the (more logical) Edit menu and renamed as Insert field.</p>

    <p>Sort command moved from the Extra menu to the (more logical) Edit menu.</p>

    <p>Sheet- and Text-oriented commands now have their own sub-menus in the Extra menu.</p>

    <h4>Dialogue boxes</h4>

    <p>Measurement (style) in Choices dialogue box is now a combo box (was previously a list box).</p>

    <p>Improved (and dynamic) layout of Save / Discard / Cancel dialogue box on close (and quit) with modified document(s).</p>

    <p>Cosmetic improvements (vertical spacing) to the Quit and Close modified dialogue boxes.</p>

    <p>Added Cancel button to New Style dialogue box.</p>

    <p>
        Buttons reordered in Style dialogue box.
        Default button is now Change (was Apply) as this is less destructive on accidental double-click.
    </p>

    <p>Select template dialogue box now discriminates between usage as 'New document' and 'Select template' for inserted files.</p>

    <p>Windows: Open File dialogue box warns about trying to open ZIP files.</p>

    <p>Windows: Initial Open File dialogue box is now the same style as subsequent ones.</p>

    <p>Windows: Save As uses file type selected by the combo box dropdown, not that typed by the user, which may be deliberately different.</p>


    <h4>Other</h4>

    <p>
        Alternate formula style choice available, which shows initial equal sign, cell references in ranges shown with colon separator, upper-case function names and cell references.
        This also affects the output of the FORMULA_TEXT() spreadsheet function, but does NOT change the way formulae are stored in Fireworkz files.
    </p>

    <p>Alternate formula style choice is applied when displaying the Functions menu, editing in the formula line and for cells in custom function documents.</p>

    <p>Cell content is no longer clipped by borders when these are not drawn, allowing the use of narrower cell margins.</p>

    <p>Current cell style in Sheet-based templates is now a thin dark grey grid outline (was thick black border) with a paler grey background.</p>

    <p>
        The new user choices file (ChoicesDoc) can supply style updates such as Update.Current cell.
        These styles are applied to all loaded documents, updating any corresponding style definitions,
        when the <emph>Update styles from choices</emph> option is set in the Choices dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>Current cell style in old files may be individually refined using the CurCell200 template supplied in the Styles directory of the Fireworkz Examples.</p>

    <p>
        The user interface style is more configurable: a new user choices file
        (ChoicesDoc) is loaded immediately after the Config file (remaining hidden)
        and contains styles which control many aspects of the appearance of the UI.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>UI.Base: The base style that supplies defaults which may be overriden by ones from a more appropriate context</li>
        <li>UI.Border: Used in the column and row borders</li>
        <li>UI.FormulaLine: Used in the formula line</li>
        <li>UI.Ruler: Used in the horizontal and vertical rulers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        User choices RulerScale and VRuler scale are now stored in ChoicesDoc rather than Choices00.
        Any user-modified ruler scales previously stored in their Choices00 will be merged with those specified in ChoicesDoc and will be removed from the user's Choices00 on the next Choices Save.
    </p>

    <p>Edges of objects in note layer now snap correctly to ruler. Use Ctrl-drag to position edges to pixel accuracy.</p>

    <p>Position and size of objects in note layer are given when dragging / resizing.</p>

    <p>More responsive toolbar updates.</p>

    <p>
        &lt;Field<em>N</em>&gt; is displayed in documents with mailshot fields when no source document is selected.
    </p>

    <p>Windows: Toolbar buttons show info using Windows tool tips.</p>

    <p>Windows: You can now use right-click on Fill down / Fill right toolbar buttons to Fill up / Fill left.</p>

    <p>Windows: Now displays graphical 'About this program' (same as splash screen) rather than dialogue box.</p>

    <p>Windows: Splash / 'About this program' screen may be dismissed by clicking in it.</p>

    <p>Windows: Extra splash screen information added (build date, copyright info).</p>

    <p>Windows: Extra 'About this program' screen information added.</p>

    <p>Windows: Improved initial size of imported JPEGs.</p>

    <p>Windows: Note layer now uses Windows clipboard.</p>

    <p>Windows: Reinstated process status window.</p>

    <p>Windows: Improved palette for 256 colour modes to include all RISC OS Window Manager colours and better greyscale.</p>

    <p>Windows: ChoicesDoc file supplies UI.FormulaLine style which determines typeface and size used in the formula line.</p>


    <h3>Other enhancements</h3>

    <p>Fireworkz (non-Pro) issues a warning when loading documents containing database tables.</p>

    <p>
        New Fireworkz internal inline sequence (here termed U:XXXX) added to support Unicode&reg; characters that
        are imported from foreign file formats that are outside the Latin-<emph>N</emph> range in text cells.
        This inline sequence consists of a wrapped fragment of UTF-8.
        These inline sequences are currently ignored by spreadsheet functions.
    </p>

    <p>{U:XXXX} construct added to support loading and saving of the corresponding internal UTF-8 inline sequence.</p>

    <p>
        Choices supplied now use the much faster <emph>Load text as paragraphs</emph> option for plain text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Styles that are only used in Upper regions (i.e. ones that are not printed, e.g. Current cell) are not saved to the clipboard on Copy / Cut.
        This avoids polluting Letter-based documents with a Current cell style when copying via the clipboard.
        Additionally, they are not used to populate the style in the Effects or New Style (based on) dialogue boxes.
    </p>

    <p>Column and row headings now print using fonts.</p>

    <p>Charts are created with thin Chart border lines and mid-grey Plot Area border lines.</p>

    <p>Handles files having DrawFileEmbedded or DrawFileReference with no type field set as containing Draw files (type field RISC OS).</p>

    <p>Some JPEG/JFIF files (e.g. with thumbnail pictures) were not being automatically detected as such.</p>

    <p>Windows: Windows clipboard handling re-written to better support WM_RENDERALLFORMATS.</p>

    <p>Windows: Renders selection to all registered clipboard formats on document closing and on (non-urgent) application exit.</p>


    <h3>Other changes</h3>

    <p>
        Config file can use more easily recognisable three digit hexadecimal RISC OS file types.
    </p>

    <p>Config file commands BorderTypeface, RulerTypeface and StatusLine-t have been withdrawn as they have been superseded.</p>

    <p>LoadOther and SaveOther commands renamed as LoadForeign and SaveForeign for source consistency.</p>

    <p>
        Fireworkz' internal inline sequence identifier character changed to ASCII 21 (was ASCII 7).
        NB. This character value is not exposed in file data.
        This helps on RISC OS where the Font Manager SWI Font_ScanString reads a byte beyond the string length specified as
        ASCII 21 is the Font Manager Comment sequence lead-in byte and so is ignored rather than giving an Unhandled CtrlChar error.
    </p>

    <p>
        Normalised second-level message handlers to take message parameters even if they do not need all of them, which is often the case.
        Compilers generate much more efficient (and smaller) code and for the top-level handlers and so message passing within Fireworkz is far less cache-disruptive.
    </p>

    <p>Uses fast inline function to map internal document handles to the corresponding document structure.</p>

    <h4>Windows</h4>

    <p>Standard release build is now done on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 with the v120_xp platform toolset.</p>

    <p>U:XXXX inline sequences are translated to UTF-16 and rendered using the Wide Character API.</p>

    <p>Additional value Windows-&lt;XXXX&gt; added to Version information in Fireworkz file to help file portability, where &lt;XXXXe&gt; is the current Windows ANSI Code Page</p>

    <p>
        When loading supporting documents, such as custom function sheets,
        Fireworkz will first scan the path without using the .fwk extension then, if needed, try again without the extension.
        This helps with cross-platform portability and centralised storage of supporting documents.
    </p>

    <p>Updated templates in line with RISC OS ones (use of four-digit year).</p>


    <h3>Other fixes</h3>

    <p>AVG() and SUM() spreadsheet functions (also DAVG() and DSUM()) fixed: operating on extremely large ranges of individually small integers could eventually give an undetected integer overflow.</p>

    <p>Fixed an evaluator stack extension problem which could have given problems with large custom functions.</p>

    <p>Lines in the legend of scatter charts obtain the same line style as that connecting the points in each series.</p>

    <p>Fix for selection of chart objects with single lines of text.</p>

    <p>Fixed error in null event handling for row formatting.</p>

    <p>Fixed word count for text in headers and footers.</p>

    <p>Fixed some navigation errors in HTML Help.</p>

    <p>Very large numbers formatted as X# (column name) could have crashed Fireworkz.</p>

    <p>Mailshot documents may now be closed in any order.</p>

    <p>Status line cleared at end of style region editing. It used to leave stale information, especially after deleting a region.</p>

    <p>Windows: Added support for Windows-1252 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH CARON' and 'LATIN SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON' characters.</p>

    <p>Windows: Windows-1252 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH CARON', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH CARON', 'LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE OE' and 'LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE' characters now upper-case and lower-case correctly.</p>

    <p>Windows: Chart Axis dialogue box tick button icons restored.</p>

    <p>Windows: As XOR mode no longer works with GDI+, the Draw path representing the selected object in chart objects is simply rendered on top of the chart.</p>

    <p>Windows: Use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects to throttle CPU when waiting for a scheduled event and no nulls.</p>

    <p>Windows: Improved text formatting when no printer is set.</p>

    <p>Windows: Track changes to default printer whilst application is running.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed View creation to respect requested size parameters.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed CPU 100% on recalc (always processing unwanted NULL events).</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed resource leak during application exit.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed redraw of text cells during editing when background RGB was set to transparent.</p>

    <p>Windows: Fixed zooming using Ctrl+scroll wheel. Also uses larger increments when at larger zoom values.</p>


    <h3>Foreign file import</h3>

    <p>Foreign file import creates documents with /fwk extension suffix.</p>

    <p>
        Foreign file import attempts to identify untyped GIF, PNG and TIFF image files so that they are not loaded as plain text.
        These are currently unable to be loaded as image files.
    </p>

    <p>Windows: Foreign file import no longer loses imported file's path name, allowing converted file to be easily saved side-by-side with the original.</p>


    <h4>Delimited text file import (including CSV)</h4>

    <p>
        Allows single digits in dates when checking against the ISO 8601 date format
        where two digits are strictly required in the month and day components
        for compatibility with some CSV files from odd sources (banking data).
    </p>

    <p>Context for number recognition set to be the same as used by the UI.</p>

    <p>Treats Unicode LINE SEPARATOR character as a line separator.</p>

    <p>Handles Unicode characters in text fields, creating U:XXXX inline sequences.</p>


    <h4>Lotus 1-2-3 file import</h4>

    <p>.WK3 files are now recognised. Currently only labels, constant values and formula results are loaded.</p>

    <p>Creates number and date / time format strings derived from the Lotus cell format code.</p>

    <p>Creates dates in the correct century (this had been broken since 2000!).</p>

    <p>Handles date values after 1999.</p>

    <p>Handles time components in date values.</p>

    <p>Uses spreadsheet functions added for Microsoft Excel support (CLEAN(), FALSE, N(), T(), TRUE).</p>

    <p>
        No longer attempts to map Lotus 1-2-3 database spreadsheet functions directly to Fireworkz functions,
        which have different database match conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maps the Lotus 1-2-3 statistical spreadsheet functions STD() and VAR()
        to the correct corresponding population statistical functions in Fireworkz (STDP() and VARP()).
    </p>


    <h4>Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg; file import</h4>

    <p>Handles BIFF5 and BIFF8 RPN function numbers (avoids totally garbled decode).</p>

    <p>Handles BIFF2-5 whole file encryption with password (avoids garbled decode).</p>

    <p>Attempts to decode Analysis ToolPak external functions.</p>

    <p>Correctly decodes function parameter lists that themselves contain functions.</p>

    <p>
        Maps byte-oriented string spreadsheet functions
        FINDB(), LEFTB(), LENGTHB(), MIDB(), REPLACEB(), RIGHTB()
        onto their character-oriented equivalents.
    </p>

    <p>
        No longer attempts to map Microsoft Excel database spreadsheet functions directly to Fireworkz functions,
        which have different database match conditions.
    </p>

    <p>Handles documents with a single empty worksheet better.</p>

    <p>Identifies BIFF4 workbook files and attempts to load all non-empty worksheets from them into multiple Fireworkz spreadsheets (named as per Microsoft Excel worksheets).</p>

    <p>Creates correct formulae derived from shared formulas where absolute column and/or row specified.</p>

    <p>Correctly offsets data and formulae relative to the given insertion point.</p>

    <p>Correctly handles external references to the same worksheet.</p>

    <p>Creates dates correctly if file has DATEMODE 1904.</p>

    <p>Creates names correctly for older formats.</p>

    <p>Handles Unicode characters in labels, creating U:XXXX inline sequences.</p>

    <p>Preserves imported file's path name, allowing converted file to be easily saved side-by-side with the original.</p>

    <p>Inserting a Microsoft Excel file into a Letter-based document will import it in a table (as per CSV import).</p>

    <p>Reduces the grid size when loading (not inserting) a Microsoft Excel file to cater for Excel's smaller expected internal cell margins.</p>

    <p>Creates style effect layering for the worksheet, columns, rows and cells derived from the appropriate Excel XF records.</p>

    <p>Creates number and date / time format strings derived from the Excel format string / code.</p>

    <p>Correct default colour set for BIFF8 files used.</p>

    <p>Windows: Biff5/Biff8 Windows clipboard formats are now supported for import.</p>

    <p>Windows: Microsoft Excel file import correctly offsets cell content and style when data copied via the Windows clipboard is not pasted at the top left.</p>

    <p>Windows: Microsoft Excel file import correctly handles non-sector padded compound documents transferred via the Windows clipboard.</p>


    <h4>PipeDream file import</h4>

    <p>Code is both faster and more paranoid.</p>

    <p>Uses column widths from PipeDream spreadsheet files.</p>


    <h4>Plain text file import</h4>

    <p>
        Import is now controlled by <emph>Load text using delimiter</emph> option in Choices dialogue box.<br>
        If selected, plain text will load as records with fields separated by the given delimiter character.<br>
        If no delimiter character is specified, TAB is used to allow easy loading of TAB separated value (TSV) files.
    </p>

    <p>Optimised when loading into Letter-based documents.</p>

    <p>
        Splits very long lines that would not fit in a single cell (especially when accumulated using <emph>Load text as paragraphs</emph>) at a space boundary if needed.
    </p>

    <p>Extended to handle ASCII, Latin-1, UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, UTF32-BE encodings.</p>

    <p>Auto-detects file encoding using any file BOM and file content.</p>

    <p>Handles Unicode characters by creating U:XXXX inline sequences.</p>

    <p>
        Treats Unicode LINE SEPARATOR character as a line separator, meaning that it is affected by the <emph>Load text as paragraphs</emph> option.
    </p>

    <p>Always treats Unicode PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR character as ending a paragraph.</p>


    <h4>Rich Text Format file import</h4>

    <p>Handles {\* immediately preceding a CR and/or LF sequence that is then followed by an ignorable destination word.</p>

    <p>
        Handles (and currently ignores) new RTF control words with upper-case letters.
        Previously only lower-case letters were considered.
    </p>

    <p>Ignores margins, headers and footers if data is being inserted (from file or clipboard) rather than loaded.</p>

    <p>Correctly interprets paper size and margin RTF control words when not inserting.</p>

    <p>
        Handles \u<emph>N</emph> Unicode characters, creating U:XXXX inline sequences,
        also handling \uc<emph>N</emph> to discard <emph>N</emph> characters after \u<emph>N</emph>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Uses the code page found in the file to translate top bit set characters to their
        native equivalents where possible, substituting U:XXXX inline sequences where there is no native equivalent.
        This helps when loading RTF files created on other platforms
        (e.g. many of the extended characters present in Windows-1252 are also present in Acorn Extended Latin-1, but at different character positions).
    </p>

    <p>Windows: Rich Text Format file import via the Windows clipboard disabled (Text is usually better for us, and allows sane input using Character Map).</p>


    <h3>Foreign file export</h3>

    <h4>Rich Text Format file export</h4>

    <p>Wraps top bit set hex characters with \hich and \loch.</p>


    <h4>Microsoft Excel file export</h4>

    <p>
        This currently supports export in BIFF5 format, wrapped as a compound document as per Microsoft Excel 97.
        This is a R-Comp sponsored development, made freely available in this release for Fireworkz on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>The Fireworkz AND (&amp;), NOT (!) and OR (|) Boolean operators are translated to the equivalent Microsoft Excel functions when exporting as BIFF.</p>


    <h3>Windows installation</h3>

    <p>Windows: Updated installer to work better on Windows 10 and Windows 8.1.</p>

    <p>Windows: Versioning mechanism implemented to be able to automatically update each user's standard / default template sets after each application upgrade.</p>


    <h2 id="KnownProblems">Known Problems in This Release</h2>

    <p>
        If you have a text cell with an inserted name which refers directly to another cell (e.g. you have defined "fred" to be h30)
        then if the value in the cell which is referred to changes,
        the text cell is not automatically reformatted or redisplayed.
        The way to do this at the moment is to use set_name to define the name in the number cell itself (e.g. set_name("fred", calculation)).
    </p>

    <p>The dotted line drawn around chart objects when they are selected is not rendered correctly.</p>

    <h4>Windows</h4>

    <p>JPEG files inserted into Drawfiles do not render on Windows.</p>


    <h2>Transferring files between Windows and RISC OS</h2>

    <p>If you want to transfer files between Windows and RISC OS, please read the sections in the <em>Getting Started Guide</em> and the <em>User Guide</em>. There's also information in the help system on this subject.</p>

    <p>Font names stored within Draw file font table objects are mapped from RISC OS names to Windows names by the DLL DsFntMap.dll. This DLL creates and uses font mappings in the registry at</p>
