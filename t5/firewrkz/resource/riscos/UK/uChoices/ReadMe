 Fireworkz and User Choices
 --------------------------

 Fireworkz now uses the Choices$Path to access the user's Choices. 
Choices:Fireworkz. has been added to the Fireworkz$Path variable, replacing
<Fireworkz$Dir>.User.

 Choices, user dictionaries, new templates etc. are now written to the
appropriate location in <Choices$Write>.Fireworkz. Subdirectories of
<Choices$Write>.Fireworkz will be created as needed by Fireworkz.

 If this is a fresh installation of Fireworkz, Fireworkz will run the
TaskObey script file DoCopy in this Choices directory which will copy the
contents of this directory into <Choices$Write>.Fireworkz.

 As before, please note that if you already have modified user dictionaries
etc. in a previous non-choices installation of Fireworkz (i.e. one prior to
1.34/10), you may wish to copy the contents of your existing
<Fireworkz$Dir>.User tree into the new location <Choices$Write>.Fireworkz.
If so, type the following in a (Ctrl-F12) Task window:

 CDir <Choices$Write>.Fireworkz
 Copy <Fireworkz$Dir>.User.* <Choices$Write>.Fireworkz.* ~CF~NRV
