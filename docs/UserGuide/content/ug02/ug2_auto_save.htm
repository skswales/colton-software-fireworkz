    <p>Auto save automatically saves any files you have open at the interval in minutes you have specified.</p>

    <p>If the number of minutes is set to zero, Auto save is turned off.</p>

    <p>To turn Auto save on:</p>

    <p>
        Display the <span class="csg-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box by choosing
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> from the icon bar (RISC&nbsp;OS) or
        <span class="csg-menu">File</span> (Windows) menu.
    </p>

    <p>Type in the number of minutes you want between each automatic save.</p>

    <p>All open and modified Fireworkz documents will now be saved automatically at the interval you have specified.</p>

    <p>
        If a document has not already been saved once you will see a dialogue box in which
        you should name the document and click <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span>.
    </p>

    <p>If the document has been saved the Auto save process is automatic.</p>

    <p>
        Remember that Auto save can be very destructive, as well as useful.
        If you often change your mind about text in your document, you should be wary of this feature.
        You might want to go back to an older version of the file, only to find that Auto save has just overwritten it.
        Either set Auto save to off, or save a copy of the document under a different name at the start of an editing session.
        Auto save will overwrite this version, and your original will not be overwritten.
