    <h1><a name="dialogue_boxes" id="dialogue_boxes"></a>Dialogue boxes</h1>

    <p>
        You can navigate dialogue boxes in several different ways.
        The main features of dialogue boxes are shown below:
    </p>

    <p>Using the mouse, click on sections of the dialogue box you want to edit.</p>

    <p>
        Move through the dialogue box using the Tab key.
        This highlights each section in turn, allowing you to make a choice and type in your entry.
        Shift-Tab may be used to move backwards through the dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>
        Windows: If the title of a section, or an option, contains an underlined letter,
        holding down the Alt key whilst typing that letter moves you straight to that section,
        and in the case of options, turns them on as well.
        For example, typing Alt-A would take you to the Above paragraph spacing option
        in the Style editor dialogue box, and turn it on if it was turned off.
    </p>
