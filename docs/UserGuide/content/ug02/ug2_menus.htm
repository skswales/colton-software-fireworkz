    <h1><a name="menus" id="menus"></a>Menus</h1>

    <p>
        RISC&nbsp;OS: The menus in Fireworkz appear when you click the middle mouse button,
        enabling you to choose commands from them as necessary.
    </p>

    <p>Windows: The menus in Fireworkz appear at the top of each document window enabling you to choose commands from them as necessary.</p>

    <p>
        Some menu entries include an arrow leading to a sub-menu from which you should make your choice.
        Others include a keyboard short cut which enables you to bypass the menu entirely.
        This is shown by a short cut code next to the menu entry.
    </p>

    <p>
        Windows: You can also select entries from menus by typing in the underlined letter,
        preceded by Alt and the underlined letter from the menu title to select the menu.
    </p>
