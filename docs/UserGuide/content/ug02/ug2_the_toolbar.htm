    <p>
        Many word processing and editing tasks are simple and repetitive,
        so Fireworkz offers you a quick way of performing them,
        and saves you from having to hunt for the command on the menu or remember a complicated key shortcut.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the top of the document window is a toolbar containing a row of icons, called tool buttons.
        Clicking on a button performs a specific task,
        such as justifying the selected paragraph,
        changing the selected text to bold or
        cutting and pasting selected text.
        Tool buttons which are currently in use look as if they have been pressed in.
        Tool buttons which are not available for use in the current context are disabled and appear greyed out.
    </p>

    <p>
        The toolbar also enables you to set tabs, and to apply
        <a href="../ug05/ug5_working_with_styles_and_effects.htm">styles</a> and <a href="../ug05/ug5_effects.htm">effects</a>
        to selected text or at the caret.
