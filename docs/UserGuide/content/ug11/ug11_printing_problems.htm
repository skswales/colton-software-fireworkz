    <h1><a name="printing_problems" id="printing_problems"></a>Printing problems</h1>

    <p>While printing is usually as simple as clicking on the Print icon, there are times when problems occur. Most of these are due to a failure of communication between your printer and the OS printer drivers, or to incorrect information being used by one of them.</p>

    <h2>Nothing happens when I try to print</h2>

    <p>Check the following things:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The printer is connected to its power supply, switched on and switched on-line.</li>

        <li>The connection between the printer and your computer has not been broken, and the connectors at both ends of the cable are firmly seated in their sockets.</li>

        <li>If you are using a networked printer, check that you are properly logged on to the network.</li>

        <li>The printer is ready to use, i.e. is loaded with paper and has a ribbon or cartridge correctly inserted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Edges of the page are missing, although the rest prints normally</h2>

    <p>This problem is usually caused by trying to print on a larger area of the paper than the printer is physically capable of printing on. Many types of printers are not able to print edge-to-edge on a sheet of paper, so if your page design has not taken this into account your document can often not be printed as intended.</p>

    <h2>The printer produces blank pages between each page of my document</h2>

    <p>One or more blank pages inserted between each page of the document usually indicates that Fireworkz or the printer driver are using a page length which is too long.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Check the page length of your printer by referring to its documentation. You may find that the problem is due to you using the correct page length for a smaller piece of paper than you are trying to print on.</li>

        <li>Check that Fireworkz is using the correct information. Once you are sure that your printer driver is set up correctly, you can ensure that Fireworkz gets the right page size by using the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Read from printer</span> button in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Page setup</span> dialogue box.</li>
    </ul>
