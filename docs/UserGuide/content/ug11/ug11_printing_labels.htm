    <h1><a name="printing_labels" id="printing_labels"></a>Printing labels</h1>

    <p>Fireworkz includes special facilities to make it easy for you to print labels. To do this you will need your name and address list stored as a CSV, Fireworkz or other data file.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open a new document based on a label template.</li>

        <li>Drop the CSV file icon on to this document.</li>

        <li>You will see a dialogue box asking you whether you want to load the file as labels or as text. Select <span class="csg-dbox-option">Labels</span> and specify how many columns across the labels should be.</li>

        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span>. Fireworkz will create sheets of labels for you.</li>

        <li>You may wish to fine-tune the label sheets before printing them. The top, left and bottom paper margins may need resetting to match your label sheets. You may want to reduce the type size if some of the addresses are too long to fit on a label.</li>

        <li>You should expect to have to experiment with the paper definition and the other settings by printing out a page or two till you succeed in printing out a page of perfect labels.</li>

        <li>The label style has the grid switched on to help you with your fine-tuning. When you are happy with the format you should switch this off.</li>

        <li>Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Print</span> toolbar button. Once you have got your page and labels set up correctly, save the document as a template for future use.</li>
    </ol>
