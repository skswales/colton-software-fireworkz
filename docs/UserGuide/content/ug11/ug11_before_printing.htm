    <h1><a name="before_printing" id="before_printing"></a>Before printing</h1>

    <p>Before trying to print, ensure that your printer is correctly set up, loaded with paper and cartridge or ribbon, and is switched on and set on-line.</p>

    <p>Fireworkz uses the standard system printer drivers for printing, so you should also make sure that you have set this up correctly.</p>

    <p>
        On RISC&nbsp;OS, load the printer manager by double-clicking
        on the !Printers icon. Then double-click  on your
        printer's in the Printer control window which is available
        from the Printer icon bar menu. The Printer configuration
        dialogue box will be displayed; refer to the RISC&nbsp;OS User
        Guide, in conjunction with the documentation for your printer,
        for full details of this process and what to do to fine-tune your
        printer driver.
    </p>

    <p>
        On Windows, you can use the <b>Print Setup</b> dialogue box from the <b>File</b>
        menu to help set up the printer driver to print the document as
        you want. Consult your operating system and your printer documentation
        for further details.
