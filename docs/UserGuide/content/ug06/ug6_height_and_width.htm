    <h1><a name="height_and_width" id="height_and_width"></a>Height and width</h1>

    <p>This sets the size of the font.</p>

    <p>Height and width are measured in points, the traditional printing industry unit of measurement, which is 1/72nd of an inch.</p>

    <p>Usually, you will only be interested in setting the height of the font. To set the height:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click on the <b>Height</b> button in the <b>Text</b> section of the Style dialogue box.</li>

        <li>Click the arrows to increase or decrease the number shown to reach the point size you require.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The width of the font will be its correct width proportional to its height, if you leave the width set to zero. You may wish to alter the width of the font to create a special effect. This can result in unpleasantly distorted type if taken to extremes. There are two things you can do with the width option:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Setting a width smaller than the height of the type condenses it, so that it takes up less space and appears squashed.</li>

        <li>Setting a width greater than the height of the type expands it, so that it takes up more space and appears stretched.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a rule, you will only get usable results condensing serif fonts 10 per cent or less, and expanding or condensing sans serif fonts by up to a third.</p>
