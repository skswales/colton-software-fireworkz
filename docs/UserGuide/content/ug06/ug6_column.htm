    <h1><a name="column" id="column"></a>Column</h1>

    <p>The default column width is set in this section of the Style dialogue box, in the worksheets base style. However, you should not try to change column widths by changing the setting here. Each column in your worksheet has its width applied to it as an effect, so that you can change the width of each column individually by dragging its column heading.</p>

    <a name="heading" id="heading"></a>
    <h2>Column heading</h2>

    <p>The column heading is set in this section of the dialogue box. The default entry is that lower-case letters are used as column headings, so the box reads x#. The format description has the same syntax as the number formats in the Number part of the Style editor, described in the <em>User Guide</em>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To set column headings in uppercase letters, you should enter X#.</li>

        <li>To set column headings in numbers, enter #</li>

        <li>To set column headings in Roman numerals, enter r# (for lower-case) or R# (for upper-case).</li>

        <li>Titles. You can also set column headings to be text. This is useful for large spreadsheets or database type documents. Enter the text in double quotes, for example Column 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you change the column headings, check that they are still different from the row headings, or you could create a worksheet that was very confusing to use. Remember that you will still need to enter cell references in letter form.</p>
