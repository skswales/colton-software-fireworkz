    <h1><a name="margins" id="margins"></a>Margins</h1>

    <p>Margins are one of the major attributes governing the way your text is laid out on the page. Each style can have different margins set, as you may want to make your document easier to read by having some sections of text indented.</p>

    <a name="about" id="about"></a>
    <h2>About margins</h2>

    <p>Margins are the space between the edge of the printable area and the edge of the text. In the Style dialogue box you are concerned with the margins at the left and right of pages; if you want to set the top and bottom margins you should go to the Paper and Header/Footer dialogue boxes.</p>

    <p>There are three margin settings in the Style dialogue box, corresponding to the margin markers displayed on the ruler:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Paragraph margin determines the positioning of the left of the first line of the paragraph. Set it to a higher value than the left margin to <b>indent</b> the first line, or to a lower value to create a <b>hanging indent</b>.</li>

        <li>The Left margin determines the position of the left edge of further lines in the paragraph.</li>

        <li>The Right margin determines the position of the right edge of the paragraph.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course, your text will not necessarily sit flush against every margin, unless you have chosen full justification.</p>

    <p>You can check the margin settings in a style by looking at the Ruler section of the Changing style dialogue box.</p>

    <h2>Setting margins</h2>

    <p>You should set margins using the ruler, which gives you immediate feedback on screen about the results of your choices.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click in an area using the style you want to change.</li>

        <li>Drag the margin markers to the new positions. Dragging the left margin will move the paragraph margin too, and the tab markers which are expressed as offsets of the left margin.</li>

        <li>The style underlying the margins in that area is automatically updated.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can check which style sets the margins at a given point using the <b>Regions...</b> command on the <b>Style</b> menu and moving in or out till you see the margin settings in the status line.</p>
