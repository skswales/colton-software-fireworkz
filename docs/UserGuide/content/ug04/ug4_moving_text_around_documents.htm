    <h1><a name="moving_text_around_documents" id="moving_text_around_documents"></a>Moving text around documents</h1>

    <p>You will often find that you want to move sections of text around your document or from one document to another. You may decide that you want to move a paragraph from the middle to the end, for example.</p>

    <p>When you move text, it disappears from your document and is stored in a special document called the clipboard. It is kept there until you try to store a different piece of text there; only one selection can be dealt with at once. When you copy a piece of text the original version stays in the document, as well as being stored in the clipboard.</p>

    <p>To move a section of text from one place to another, follow the following procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the area of text you want to move.</li>

        <li>Click on the <b>Cut</b> button on the toolbar. This will cut the text from the document and close up the space where it was cut from.</li>

        <li>Move the pointer to the place where you want your text to go and click once, so that the caret is placed there.</li>

        <li>Click on the <b>Paste</b> button on the toolbar.</li>

        <li>Your text will appear in the new position.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may paste as many copies of your text into documents as you wish.</p>

    <p>Instead of clicking on the toolbar buttons to cut and paste, you may use the following menu commands and short cut key combinations:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the area of text to move.</li>

        <li>Display the <b>Edit</b> menu and choose <b>Cut</b>. Or enter <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-X</span> from the keyboard.</li>

        <li>Place the insertion point where you want the text to go.</li>

        <li>Display the <b>Edit</b> menu and choose <b>Paste</b>. Or enter <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-V</span> from the keyboard.</li>

        <li>Your text will appear in the new position.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note that the Paste button will become highlighted and remain highlighted once you have done a cut or copy operation within the document. The text you cut or copied will stay on the clipboard until next time you do a cut or copy.</p>

    <p>You can paste as many copies of the contents of the clipboard into the document as you like.</p>
