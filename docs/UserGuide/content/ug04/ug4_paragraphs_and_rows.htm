    <h1><a name="paragraphs_and_rows" id="paragraphs_and_rows"></a>Paragraphs and rows</h1>

    <p>
        If you turn <b>Row borders</b> on (from the <a href="../ug02/ug2_accessing_the_view_control_dialogue_box.htm"><b>View control</b></a> dialogue box) you
        will see that each paragraph is a separate row. Whenever you
        press Return, a new row/paragraph is started, contained in its
        own cell and with the additional paragraph spacing rather than
        just the line spacing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The lines inside the row/paragraph are spaced according to the
        line spacing only, without the extra above/below paragraph
        space added. However, you may want to start new paragraphs
        but keep them linked together as part of the same row. For
        example, if you type in an address you have to press Return to
        start each new line, but you don't want each line to be treated
        separately.
        This will start a new line with a line space rather than a paragraph space between the lines; see <a href="ug4_starting_a_new_line_without_starting_a_new_paragraph.htm">Starting a new line without starting a new paragraph</a>.
