        <li>
            Don't use spaces to indent paragraphs; use the margin markers instead.
            This makes it much easier to align several paragraphs accurately.
        </li>

        <li>
            Don't use extra Returns to add space between paragraphs.
            Use the <a href="../ug06/ug6_the_style_editor.htm">Style editor</a> to add extra space between paragraphs (Paragraph in the spacing section),
            or to adjust a single paragraph space, turn on the row border and drag extra space using the markers.
        </li>

        <li>
            Set up Fireworkz to suit your way of working.
            Experiment with features such as <a href="../ug02/ug2_auto_save.htm">Auto save</a> and <a href="ug4_checking_spellings.htm">Check as you type</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            When you have text selected, be careful about typing any new text as the selected text will be replaced with what you type.
            Pressing the delete or backspace keys will also delete all selected text.
        </li>

        <li>
            Some options, such as <a href="../ug06/ug6_alignment.htm">justification</a>, can only be applied to whole paragraphs.
            If you want to justify a single line, you must make sure that it is in a paragraph of its own.
            Alter the row height to change the paragraph spacing if required.
        </li>

        <li>Add internal returns to paragraphs and table and spreadsheet cells by pressing <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Return</span>.</li>
