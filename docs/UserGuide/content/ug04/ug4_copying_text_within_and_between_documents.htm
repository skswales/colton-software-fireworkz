    <h1><a name="copying_text_within_and_between_documents" id="copying_text_within_and_between_documents"></a>Copying text within and between documents</h1>

    <p>Sometimes you may wish to make an extra copy of part of your text. For example, you may want to copy a paragraph into a second document without deleting it from the first.</p>

    <p>You can also copy text between open documents, so that you paste the text you have copied from one document into another document</p>

    <p>The procedure for doing this is as follows:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the area of text you want to copy.</li>

        <li>Click on the <b>Copy</b> button on the toolbar (or choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu).</li>

        <li>Move the pointer to the place where you want your text to go and click so that the caret is placed there. This can be within the same document or within another open document.</li>

        <li>Click on the <b>Paste</b> button on the toolbar (or choose <b>Paste</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu).</li>

        <li>Your second copy of the text will appear in the new position or the other document.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may paste as many copies of your text into documents as you wish.</p>
