    <p>This chapter explains how to create charts from data that you have entered in your worksheet.</p>
    <p>It includes sections on:</p>

    <h2><a name="creating_a_chart" id="creating_a_chart"></a>Creating a chart</h2>

    <p>The first step in creating a chart is to enter or compute your data within a worksheet.</p>

    <h3>Preparing your data</h3>
    <p>There are ways to organise your data to make it easier to build a chart.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Charts are initially constructed out of contiguous ranges of cells.
            So it is easier if your data can be selected in this way.
            Once a chart has been created, extra data can be added to it from other parts of the worksheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Charts use row and column headings which have been entered in text cells as labels for the legend and data series within the chart.
            If your data is clearly labelled on the worksheet it will make it much easier to set up your chart and understand it on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most of the chart dialogue boxes enable you to specify that the
            first row or column in the range is used as the legend or as labels rather than as data.
            Usually, Fireworkz will detect text and treat it as a label automatically,
            but if you want numeric labels for data in your chart you will need to specify this.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Making the chart</h3>
    <p>Follow this process to make your chart:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/chart.png" alt="Chart tool button">
            Select the range of data you want to include in the chart, and click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Chart</span> tool button on the toolbar.
            The data must include some number cells.
        </li>
        <li>The chart menu will appear, from which you should choose the type of chart you want.</li>
        <li>
            A dialogue box for that type of chart will appear.
            Choose the type you want by clicking on the icons, and enter any other details necessary in the dialogue box.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span>.
            Your chart will be generated and appear on the worksheet in its own frame, just beneath the data on which it was based.
            In some cases (such as low-resolution screen modes) this may be off the screen.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Types of chart</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz provides several different types of chart for you to use in your documents.
        The following options are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bar charts</li>
        <li>Line charts</li>
        <li>Pie charts</li>
        <li>X-Y scatter graphs</li>
        <li>Overlays (mixing bar and line charts)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each type is described in turn in the next few sections.
        Each basic option contains several different versions of the chart type,
        so that a wide variety of charts can be generated.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="bar_charts" id="bar_charts"></a>Bar charts</h2>
    <p>
        Bar charts display data as a series of bars measured against an axis.
        A variety of types of bars are available in Fireworkz, including pictograms and three-dimensional bars.
        When you choose the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Bar</span> option on the <span class="csg-menu">Chart</span> menu,
        the <span class="csg-dbox">Bar chart</span> dialogue box will appear.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the image button representing the type of chart you want.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">3-D</span> option if you want a three-dimensional chart.</li>
        <li>Specify whether the data series are in columns or rows.</li>
        <li>Specify whether the first points in each series are labels or data.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            Your chart will be generated ready for further editing if required.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="types_of_bar_chart" id="types_of_bar_chart"></a>Types of bar chart</h3>
    <p>There are eight types of bar chart available in Fireworkz, which can be further customised using the options available.</p>

    <h4>Bar</h4>
    <p>The first two buttons draw simple bar charts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first button draws a chart where each series has a different colour.</li>
        <li>The second button draws a chart where each category has a different colour.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Stacked bar</h4>
    <p>The third button produces a stacked bar chart in which all data series within each category are combined into a single bar.</p>

    <h4>Percentage stacked bar</h4>
    <p>The fourth button gives a percentage stacked bar chart, where the data series within each category are expressed as percentages.</p>

    <h4>Pictograms</h4>
    <p>
        The buttons in the third row produce <a href="#pictograms">pictograms</a>, in which the bars of the chart are made up out of pictures.
        Any Draw file or sprite file can be used as the basis of a pictogram.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first button creates a pictogram where the original image is stacked up as many times as necessary to create the correct height of bar.
            The number of pictures that appear is dependent on the tick positions on the Y axis.
            If the number is between two tick positions, it is always rounded to the nearest tick.
        </li>
        <li>The second button stretches the image to create a bar of the correct height.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following tips apply for successful use of pictograms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use only one data series to reduce clutter.</li>
        <li>Don't have too many points on it.</li>
        <li>
            Use simple (fast-drawing), colourful, meaningful pictures for best effect,
            such as company logos or the flags from the Example directory.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Error bars</h4>
    <p>
        This type of chart includes extension to the bars showing the potential error margin.
        Two consecutive data series are used to construct each bar;
        the first is used for the solid bar and the second for the error bar.
    </p>

    <h4>Cumulative bar chart</h4>
    <p>
        This option creates a bar chart where each new data point is added to the previous one,
        so the size of the bars will normally increase along the x-axis.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="line_charts" id="line_charts"></a>Line charts</h2>

    <p>Line charts are ideal for showing changes in a series of data over time.</p>
    <p>
        When you choose the <span class="csg-menu-option">Line chart</span> option from the
        <span class="csg-menu">Chart</span> menu the <span class="csg-dbox">Line chart</span> dialogue box will appear.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the image button representing the type of chart you want.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="csg-dbox-option">3-D</span> option if you want a three-dimensional ribbon chart.</li>
        <li>Specify whether the data series are in columns or rows.</li>
        <li>Specify whether the first points in each series are labels or data.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            Your chart will be generated ready for further editing if required.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="types_of_line_chart" id="types_of_line_chart"></a>Types of line chart</h3>
    <p>There are eight line chart options available, consisting of four main types drawn with and without data points:</p>

    <h4>Simple line chart</h4>
    <p>This chart draws a line between the data points in each series.</p>

    <h4>Area chart</h4>
    <p>
        This chart draws a line between the data points, and then shades the area between this line and the axes of the chart.
        A further line is drawn from the x-axis to each data point.
    </p>

    <h4>Stacked area chart</h4>
    <p>This chart stacks data series, drawing a line between the points in each and shading the area between each line and the line below it.</p>

    <h4>Line chart with error bars</h4>
    <p>
        This chart draws a line with error bars extending from each data point.
        Each line in the chart requires two series of data; the first is used for the line data point and the second to place the error bar.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="pie_charts" id="pie_charts"></a>Pie charts</h2>

    <p>Pie charts are good for showing the relationships between a group of figures in proportion to the total.</p>
    <p>Several different types of chart are available from the <span class="csg-dbox">Pie chart</span> dialogue box.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the image button representing the type of pie chart <a href="pie_labelling_options">labels</a> you want.</li>
        <li>Click the segment layout image button you want, and set the distance for <a href="#pie_exploding_segments">exploded segments</a> if required.</li>
        <li>Click any options you require for custom <a href="#pie_start_position">starting points</a> or <a href="#pie_direction">direction</a>.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            Your pie chart will be generated and placed in the worksheet.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="pie_labelling_options" id="pie_labelling_options"></a>Labelling options</h4>
    <p>
        The four image buttons in the top row represent labelling options.
        Click the appropriate button to produce a pie with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No labels</li>
        <li>Letters as labels</li>
        <li>Values as labels</li>
        <li>Percentages as labels</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="pie_exploding_segments" id="pie_exploding_segments"></a>Exploding segments</h4>
    <p>
        The three image buttons in the next row represent explosion options.
        Exploding one or more segments of the pie can draw attention to that segment.
        Click the appropriate button for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No segments exploded</li>
        <li>The first segment exploded</li>
        <li>All segments exploded</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You should also specify the distance you want the segment(s) to be exploded.
        This is expressed as the percentage of the radius of the segment which falls outside the pie itself.
        Click the arrow buttons to increase or decrease the number, or type one in directly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you specify exploded segments you must specify a percentage greater than 0%, or the segments will not appear exploded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="pie_start_position" id="pie_start_position"></a>Start position</h4>
    <p>
        You can also specify whereabouts on the circle you want the pie to begin.
        Either click on one of the eight radio buttons, or type in a number in degrees (0 to 359).
    </p>

    <h4><a name="pie_direction" id="pie_direction"></a>Direction</h4>
    <p>
        The chart can proceed either clockwise (the default) or anti-clockwise.
        Click the option button if you want an anti-clockwise chart.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="x_y_scatter_graphs" id="x_y_scatter_graphs"></a>X-Y Scatter plots</h2>

    <p>Scatter plots display data as discrete points and with or without lines between them.</p>
    <p>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/chart.png" alt="Chart tool button">
        To create a scatter plot, select your data in the worksheet and click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Chart</span> tool button on the toolbar.
        Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">X-Y</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Chart</span> menu and a dialogue box will appear.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the image button for the type of scatter plot you want.</li>
        <li>Specify whether the data series are in columns or rows.</li>
        <li>
            Specify how the data series are arranged.<br />
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">X, Y, Y</span> means that you want to plot more than one y-series against a single x-series.<br />
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">X, Y, X, Y</span> means that for each y-series you are supplying an x-series.
        </li>
        <li>Specify whether the first points in each series are labels or data.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Create</span></span> and your scatter plot will be drawn.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="types_of_scatter_graph" id="types_of_scatter_graph"></a>Types of scatter graph</h3>
    <p>
        There are nine types of scatter graph, based on three types of graph
        to which vertical error bars or vertical and horizontal error bars can be added.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two sets of data are required for each point, to provide the x- and y-coordinates respectively.
        Vertical error bars are taken from the third set of data, and horizontal error bars from the fourth.
    </p>

    <h4>Line</h4>
    <p>
        A line is drawn from point to point.
        Note that Fireworkz does not automatically sort data for charts,
        and you should therefore sort the x-coordinates in ascending order
        or your line could travel both forwards and backwards across the chart.
    </p>

    <h4>Point</h4>
    <p>Each data point is represented by a blob at its x,y coordinate.</p>

    <h4>Line and point</h4>
    <p>Each data point is represented by a blob, and a line is drawn between the data points.</p>

    <h2><a name="overlays" id="overlays"></a>Overlays</h2>

    <p>
        Overlays place two y-axes on the same chart, one of which is placed at the left of the chart and one at the right.
        Each axis can be scaled differently and your data series can be plotted against either of the axes.
        To work with overlays:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/chart.png" alt="Chart tool button">
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Overlay</span> from the menu which appears
            when you click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Chart</span> tool button on the toolbar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select the option you require from the <span class="csg-dbox">Overlay</span> dialogue box.
            Choose one of <span class="csg-dbox-option">Bar-bar</span>,
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Bar-line</span>,
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Line-Line</span> or
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Scatter-Scatter</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fireworkz automatically divides the data series into two and plots
            the first half on the left axis and the second half on the right axis.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a series appears on the wrong half of the chart, select it and change its status
            in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Overlay</span> section of the <span class="csg-dbox">Series</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="editing_charts" id="editing_charts"></a>Editing your chart</h2>

    <p>Once you have created a chart, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resize it</li>
        <li>Reposition it on the page</li>
        <li>Use <span class="csg-menu-option">Make constant</span> to turn it into a Draw file</li>
        <li>Save it as a Draw file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most of these actions are the same as those which apply to pictures.
        See the earlier chapter,
        <em><a href="../ug/ug10_pictures.htm#adding_pictures_to_your_document">Pictures</a></em>,
        for details of how to perform them.
    </p>
    <p>Depending on the type of chart which you have created, you can also use specific chart commands to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the labelling on the axes</li>
        <li>Change the colours used in the charts</li>
        <li>Add extra series of data to a chart</li>
        <li>Change the angle of viewing of a 3-D chart</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following sections on each type of chart outline the editing possibilities for each type.</p>
    <p>
        You cannot change the type of a chart once you have created it.
        For example, if you have made a bar chart you cannot turn it into a pie chart.
        If you decide that you have made the wrong kind of chart,
        you should simply delete the chart by selecting it and pressing the Delete key,
        select the data again, and create a new chart.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="updating_chart_data" id="updating_chart_data"></a>Updating chart data</h3>
    <p>
        The data in your chart is taken live from your spreadsheet.
        If this data changes, either because you have edited it or because of a recalculation, the chart will automatically be redrawn and updated.
        This happens until you turn the chart into a Draw file using <span class="csg-menu-option">Make constant</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>&lsquo;Live&rsquo; charts vs. &lsquo;dead&rsquo; charts</h3>
    <p>
        When you create a chart, you may have one of two intentions.
        You will probably want your chart to continue to reflect your data and any changes in it, to help you to analyse your data as you work.
        Or you may want your chart to present a snapshot of the data at that time.
        Fireworkz allows you to choose which of these options you prefer.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Charts that change if the data in the range of cells from which they were created changes are called &lsquo;live&rsquo; or dynamic charts.</li>
        <li>Charts which will not be updated if the data changes are &lsquo;dead&rsquo; charts, and can be saved as Draw files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accessing the chart menus</h3>
    <p>
        To edit charts, you need to use the chart menus and dialogue boxes.
        To access these, the chart must be selected for editing.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Double-click within the chart frame, and you will see that a double red border appears around the chart area.
            The chart is now selected for editing.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you want to edit or change the appearance of a particular section of the chart
            (such as the y-axis, or a single data point), you need to select it as well.<br />
            <em>Data points</em><br />
            For a single data point click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> (RISC OS) or Ctrl-click on the part of the chart required.<br />
            <em>Data series</em><br />
            For a series, click on a point within the series.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see a dotted line appear around the selected part of the chart.
            The selected area will also be described in the status line for example <em>Series 1</em> or <em>Series 2, point 1</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you have selected the chart frame and the part of the chart you want to change, you will be able to access the chart menus.
            On RISC OS, the chart menus appear if you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> within the chart area.
            On Windows, the chart menu bar replaces the standard menu bar at the top of the Fireworkz window.
        </li>
        <li>You can choose the option you want and edit the chart.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="customising_bar_charts" id="customising_bar_charts"></a>Customising bar charts</h3>
    <p>There are several options for customising bar charts:</p>

    <h4>Bar positioning</h4>
    <p>
        You can customise the position of bars in the chart using the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Chart</span> dialogue box from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu accessed from the <span class="csg-menu">Chart</span> menu.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first option sets the percentage of the space per data point taken up by the bar.</li>
        <li>The second sets the overlap for bars</li>
        <li>The third sets the depth for 3-D bars.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Three-dimensional charts</h4>
    <p>
        All bar charts can be made three-dimensional by selecting the <span class="csg-dbox-option">3-D</span> option when you create the chart
        or by setting the option button in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">3-D</span> section of this dialogue box.
        They may be made two-dimensional by unsetting this option button.
    </p>
    <p>You can also edit the pitch and roll of 3-D charts using the <span class="csg-dbox">Chart</span> dialogue box.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Enter the pitch and roll in degrees.
            This will change the viewing angle of the 3-D chart.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="editing_axes" id="editing_axes"></a>Editing axes</h3>
    <p>
        When Fireworkz draws your chart it will endeavour to produce the most acceptable divisions on the axes.
        However, you may want more or less precise numerical divisions, or a different type of tick mark.
    </p>
    <p>To edit an axis:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Double-click on the chart to select it.
            A double line will appear around the entire chart.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> (the left mouse button) on the axis you want to edit.
            A border will appear to show that it has been selected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Axis</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.
            The <span class="csg-dbox">Axis</span> dialogue box will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Edit the axis as necessary.
            Options available here include setting the numerical divisions on the axis, the position of the axis on the chart, grid lines and tick marks, and scaling.
            You can also opt to stack data series here, changing your bar or line chart into a stacked chart.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you have set all the options you require, click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
            Your chart will be redrawn.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="using_colour_in_charts" id="using_colour_in_charts"></a>Using colour in charts</h3>
    <p>
        Charts are created using a default set of colours for each item.
        However, you may want to edit these, either for the whole chart or for individual items.
    </p>
    <p>You may edit both the fill colours used for areas, bars and pies, and the line colours used for other objects.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            Select the fill style.
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Solid</span> fills with a solid colour.
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Picture</span> enables you to import a picture which you can choose from the pop-up menu.

    <h2><a name="editing_text_in_charts" id="editing_text_in_charts"></a>Editing text in charts</h2>

    <p>
        You cannot type text directly into your charts.
        Any text must be selected in the worksheet when the chart is created, or added later using the <span class="csg-menu-option">Add</span> command.
    </p>

    <h3>Arranging the legend</h3>

        edit the margins as above to increase the space available.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the style of text</h3>
    <p>
        You may change the style and colour of text directly in the chart.
        To do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the text you want to change.</li>
        <li>Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Text</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu.</li>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox">Text style</span> dialogue box will appear.</li>
        <li>
            Choose the typeface you want from the list, and if required select the
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Bold</span> and/or <span class="csg-dbox-option">Italic</span> option buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter a height for the text (i.e. its point size).
            If you do not specify a width, the natural width of the type will be used.
        </li>
        <li>Specify a colour for the text.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span> to confirm your changes.</li>
