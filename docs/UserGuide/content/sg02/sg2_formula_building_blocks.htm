    <h1><a name="formula_building_blocks" id="formula_building_blocks"></a>Formula building blocks</h1>

    <p>A formula is anything you enter into a number cell. You create and edit it in the formula line, and then enter it into the cell by clicking on the <b>Tick</b> button or pressing <b>Return&crarr;</b>. A formula can be as simple as just a number, or it can be very complex and built using operators, functions, cell references, ranges, arrays, and other types of data.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of formulae:</p>

    <p>7+6</p>

    <p>B8</p>

    <p>A7*15</p>

    <p>D20*VAT</p>

    <p>SUM(B2:B11)</p>

    <p>LOOKUP(A2:A11, MAX(A2:A11))</p>

    <p>IF(D12&gt;50, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)</p>

    <p>Some of these formulae perform quite simple operations, using the standard mathematical symbols for addition, multiplication and so on. These symbols, when used in a formula, are called <a href="sg2_using_operators_in_formulae.htm">operators</a>, because they represent an operation which is carried out on the data.</p>

    <p>Other formulae include <a href="sg2_the_function_selector.htm">functions</a>. These are more complex operations, which perform an operation which is often well described by their name.</p>

    <p>Other elements which can appear in formulae are <a href="../sg01/sg1_cell_references.htm">cell references</a>, numbers, <a href="sg2_arrays.htm">arrays</a>, <a href="sg1_external_references.htm">external references</a>, and <a href="sg2_names.htm">names</a>.</p>
