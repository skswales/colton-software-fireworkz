    <h1><a name="the_region_editor" id="the_region_editor"></a>The region editor</h1>

    <p>The region editor is a tool for managing styles and effects which have been applied to the text in your documents. It allows you to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Examine the styles and effects (including tables, borders and boxes) which have been applied to an area</li>

        <li>Count the number of regions of style or effect which have been created in the document</li>

        <li>Remove applied styles or effects from the document one by one. (see <a href="ug5_removing_styles_and_effects.htm">Removing styles and effects)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>To see the styles and effects applied to any text, you can use the style region editor. This also enables you to remove any styles or effects from an area, and to see how the layering of styles affects the look of the document content at any point.</p>

    <p>The style region editor tells you the name of styles applied to an area, and gives details of effects such as bold, italic, grids and boxes. This information will appear in the status line.</p>

    <p>To use the style region editor:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret in the area you want to look at.</li>

        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Regions</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu and choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Edit</span>. The <span class="csg-dbox">Region</span> dialogue box will appear, and the name of the style or effect most recently applied to the area will be shown on the status line.</li>

        <li>To look at other styles and effects applied to the area, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">In</span> button in the <span class="csg-dbox">Region</span> dialogue box. You can move inwards as far as the base style of the document. As you move in, the selection will change to show you the area to which the style named or effects shown in the status line is applied.</li>

        <li>Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Out</span> button to move back out through the layers of styles.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="navfooter">
        <table id="navfooter" summary="Navigation footer">
            <tr>
                <td id="navfooter_PUN_L"><a accesskey="p" href="ug5_layering_styles.htm">Prev</a> </td>
                <td id="navfooter_PUN_C"><a accesskey="u" href="ug5_working_with_styles_and_effects.htm">Up</a></td>
