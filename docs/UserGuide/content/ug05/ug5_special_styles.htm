    <h1><a name="special_styles" id="special_styles"></a>Special styles</h1>

    <p>When you open a new document it already contains several styles which are predefined in the template on which the document is based. Some of these styles have special purposes and you cannot set one up yourself.</p>

    <h2>Base style</h2>

    <p>The base style of the document behaves slightly differently from other styles. When you examine its contents, you will see that the buttons, which are normally red to show that an area is selected, are grey and cannot be switched off.</p>

    <h2>Current cell</h2>

    <p>All documents created as sheets in Fireworkz contain a current cell style. This style is used in tables and worksheets to show the cell which is currently selected, that is where any data or formula entered on the editing line will appear on the sheet when you press Return.</p>

    <p>The default current cell style is that a border appears around the cell, and that the cell has a grey background. You can, of course, edit the style of the cell so that a different colour is used for its contents, and so on.</p>

    <p>Most of the time you wouldn't want a current cell style in a document which was mostly text, as you would have an irritating border around the paragraph you were typing.</p>
