    <h1><a name="what_are_styles" id="what_are_styles"></a>What are styles?</h1>

    <p>Styles are sets of choices which determine the appearance and layout of numbers, text cells, rows and dates within your worksheet. Aspects of style include: the margins of each cell; the typeface used, its size, colour and any special attributes applied to it; and the alignment of figures within a cell. These are referred to in the following sections as attributes.</p>

    <p>To see the list of styles available for use in any worksheet document, click the <b>Style</b> button in the toolbar, or choose <b>Styles...</b> from the <b>Style</b> menu. You will see a selection window containing a list similar to this:</p>

    <p>Styles provide a mechanism for changing the look of a worksheet quickly and easily. All styles contained in the worksheet are listed in the Style selector; to add a style to part of a worksheet, simply select it, click on the <b>Style</b> button, select the preferred style from the list and click <b>Apply</b>.</p>

    <p>Styles can quickly be changed; any changes made will be applied to all occurrences of that style within the worksheet.</p>

    <p>Using styles can save you a lot of time in formatting your worksheets, as well as ensuring consistency. For example, you can define a Totals style, and use it to highlight all totals within your worksheet. If the Totals style uses a different typeface, in a different size, and with extra spacing beneath compared to the style used for ordinary cells, the ability to apply a style with a couple of clicks can save you a lot of time even in short documents.</p>
