    <h1><a name="editing_charts" id="editing_charts"></a>Editing charts</h1>

    <p>Once you have created a chart, you can:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>resize it;</li>
        <li>reposition it on the page;</li>
        <li>use <b>Make constant</b> to turn it into a Draw file;</li>
        <li>save it as a Draw file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Most of these actions are the same as those which apply to pictures.
        See the previous chapter, <i><a href="../ug10/ug10_adding_pictures_to_your_document.htm">Graphics</a></i>, for details of how to perform them.
    </p>

    <p>Depending on the type of chart which you have created, you can also use specific chart commands to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Change the labelling on the axes</li>
        <li>Change the colours used in the charts</li>
        <li>Add extra series of data to a chart</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following sections on each type of chart outline the editing possibilities for each type.</p>

    <p>
        You cannot change the type of a chart once you have created it.
        For example, if you have made a bar chart you cannot turn it into a pie chart.
        If you decide that you have made the wrong kind of chart,
        you should simply delete the chart by selecting it and pressing the Delete key,
        select the data again, and create a new chart.
