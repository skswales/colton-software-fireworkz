    <h1><a name="types_of_bar_chart" id="types_of_bar_chart"></a>Types of bar chart</h1>

    <p>There are eight types of bar chart available in Fireworkz, which can be further customised using the options available.</p>

    <h2>Bar</h2>

    <p>The first two buttons draw simple bar charts.</p>

    <p>The first button draws a chart where each series has a different colour.</p>

    <p>The second button draws a chart where each category has a different colour.</p>

    <h2>Stacked bar</h2>

    <p>The third button produces a stacked bar chart in which all data series are combined into a single bar.</p>

    <h2>Percentage stacked bar</h2>

    <p>The fourth button gives a percentage stacked bar chart, where the data series within each category are expressed as percentages.</p>

    <h2>Pictograms</h2>

    <p>The buttons in the third row produce <a href="sg4_pictograms.htm">pictograms</a>, in which the bars of the chart are made up out of pictures. Any sprite file or draw file can be used as the basis of a pictogram.</p>

    <h2>Error bars</h2>

    <p>This type of chart includes extension to the bars showing the potential error margin. Two consecutive data series are used to construct each bar; the first is used for the solid bar and the second for the error bar.</p>

    <h2>Cumulative bar chart</h2>

    <p>This option creates a bar chart where each new data point is added to the previous one, so the size of the bars will normally increase along the x axis.</p>
