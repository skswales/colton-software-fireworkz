    <h1><a name="updating_chart_data" id="updating_chart_data"></a>Updating chart data</h1>

    <p>The data in your chart is taken live from your spreadsheet. If this data changes, either because you have edited it or because of a recalculation, the chart will automatically be redrawn and updated.</p>

    <p>This happens until you turn the chart into a Draw file.</p>

    <h2>Live charts versus dead charts</h2>

    <p>When you create a chart, you may have one of two intentions. You will probably want your chart to continue to reflect your data and any changes in it, to help you to analyse your data as you work. Or you may want your chart to present a snapshot of the data at that time. Fireworkz allows you to choose which of these options you prefer. Charts that change if the data in the range of cells from which they were created changes are called live or dynamic charts. Charts which will not be updated if the data changes are dead charts, and can be saved as Draw files.</p>
