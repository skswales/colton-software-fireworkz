    <p>
        Some types of information are much better presented in tables
        rather than as running text. You should consider presenting any
        numerical information, or lists, in table format. Tables are easily
        created and edited, and are ideal for creating a wide range of
        forms and reports.
    </p>
    <p>This chapter shows you how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#adding_tables">Create a new table within your document</a></li>
        <li><a href="#editing_table_layouts">Edit the layout of the table to suit your need by altering the number and width of columns and rows</a></li>

        <li><a href="#using_styles_and_effects_in_tables">Use styles and effects in tables</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The information in this section can also be applied to designing spreadsheet documents.
        Simply select the area of spreadsheet you want to format, and add grids, borders and backgrounds as if it were a table.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="table_basics" id="table_basics"></a>Table basics</h2>

    <p>
        Tables are a way of presenting information which is neat and easily understandable.
        Transport timetable information and the ingredients in a recipe are two everyday examples of information which can be presented in tables.
        Forms such as software registration cards or school worksheets can also be created as tables.
    </p>
    <p>Tables can range from a simple two-column list, to large and detailed documents.</p>
    <h3>The language of tables</h3>
    <p>
        Some basic terms are used within Fireworkz and throughout the computer world to refer to the parts which make up a table.
        They are the same as the words used to describe the content of a spreadsheet.
        These terms are used throughout this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
        A table is made up of vertical <strong>columns</strong> and horizontal <strong>rows</strong>.
        The intersections of these are called <strong>cells</strong>, and this is where you enter your text or data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cells can be shown more clearly by a <strong>grid</strong>, a pattern of lines showing the boundary between each row and column.
        Each cell can also have its own <strong>border</strong>, and cells can be given a <strong>background colour</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="adding_tables" id="adding_tables"></a>Adding tables</h2>

    <p>
        Tables are easily added to any Fireworkz document.
        You can add tables to both letter and worksheet documents.
    </p>
    <p>To add a table to a document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret at the place where you want the table to start.</li>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-dbox-option">Table</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.
            The <span class="csg-dbox">Insert table</span> dialogue box will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter the number of columns and the number of rows you want in the table.
            If you are not sure exactly how many you will need, enter the approximate number; its easy to add or remove rows and columns later.
        </li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Insert</span></span> in the dialogue box.</li>
        <li>
            The table will appear.
            A new style will be added to the document.
            For the first table in a document it will be called .Table1; for subsequent tables it will have an appropriate number.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can now go on to edit and customise your table.
        See <a href="ug8_editing_table_layouts.htm">Editing table layouts</a>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="editing_table_layouts" id="editing_table_layouts"></a>Editing table layouts</h3>
    <p>
        Editing table layouts is made easy by Fireworkz.
        Most changes can be made by selecting the part of the table you want to change, and dragging it to the new size in the ruler.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it is not already displayed, you should switch on the Side ruler in the
        <a href="../ug/ug02_fireworkz_basics.htm#accessing_the_view_control_dialogue_box.htm"><span class="csg-dbox">View control</span></a> dialogue box.
        This makes it much easier to resize rows.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="editing_the_cell_layout" id="editing_the_cell_layout"></a>Editing the cell layout</h4>
    <p>
        The cell layout for each table is defined in the corresponding style .Table<em>N</em>
        which is automatically created when you add a table to your document.
        These are the default table settings, which you will probably want to alter:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The text will appear in the same style as the base style of the document.</li>
        <li>A black grid will appear around all four sides of each cell.</li>
        <li>The three margins are set to 2mm from the edge of the cell.</li>
        <li>No tabs are set.</li>
        <li>The column width is set to 20mm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should make any changes which you want to apply to the whole table by altering the settings in the ruler when no area of the table is selected.</p>
    <p>
        The type style, border, colours and the grid are altered using the
        <a href="../ug/ug06_the_style_editor.htm">Style dialogue box</a>
        by editing the appropriate table style or creating new styles and applying them to the table.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="merging_two_cells" id="merging_two_cells"></a>Merging two cells</h4>
    <p>
        You may wish to remove column boundaries in some rows of your table,
        perhaps because a row is being used as a heading or break in the table.
        The method described here is one way to do this:
        you could also <a href="#straddling_cells">straddle</a> the two cells.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the left of the two cells you want to merge.</li>
        <li>Point at the column width marker at its righthand side.</li>
        <li>Press the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button and drag the column width marker to the edge of the righthand of the two cells.</li>
        <li>
            When you release the left mouse button you will see that the cell boundary has disappeared.
            You can repeat this process across as many columns as you need,
            but if you want to widen a cell over several columns you have to do it from right to left, column by column.
            This is because you can only drag one column border at a time in this way.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="straddling_cells" id="straddling_cells"></a>Straddling cells</h4>
    <p>
        There is a simple and convenient way to merge a pair of cells in a row.
        This is called straddling.
        To do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the two cells which you wish to straddle.</li>
        <li>Point at the column border between the two cells.</li>
        <li>Control-double click (or, RISC OS only, <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> double-click).</li>
        <li>The two cells will merge.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="adding_extra_rows_and_columns" id="adding_extra_rows_and_columns"></a>Adding extra rows and columns</h4>
    <p>
        There are two options for adding extra rows and columns to a table.
        You may either insert additional rows and columns at a point within the table,
        or add rows and columns to the end of an existing table.
    </p>
    <p>To insert extra rows within a table:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret within the table at the point where you want to insert an extra row.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Rows</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.</li>
        <li>Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert</span> from that sub-menu.</li>
        <li>An extra row will be inserted into the table.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To insert extra columns within a table:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret within the table at the point where you want to insert an extra row or column.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Columns</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.</li>
        <li>Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert</span> from that sub-menu.</li>
        <li>An extra column will be inserted into the table.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To add rows to the bottom of a table:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret in the last row of the table</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Rows</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Add</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Row</span> sub-menu.
            The <span class="csg-dbox">Add Rows</span> dialogue box will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the number of rows to add by typing in the writable field or by using the arrows.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Add</span></span>.
            The extra rows will be added.
            They will be displayed in the table style for this table.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To add columns to the right of a table:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the caret in the last column of the table</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Columns</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Add</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Columns</span> sub-menu.
            The <span class="csg-dbox">Add Columns</span> dialogue box will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the number of columns to add by typing in the writable field or by using the arrows.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Add</span></span>.
            The extra columns will be added.
            They will be displayed in the table style for this table.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="removing_redundant_rows_and_columns" id="removing_redundant_rows_and_columns"></a>Removing redundant rows and columns</h4>
    <p>To remove a row or column from the table:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the row or column to remove by clicking in the top or leftmost cell and dragging down to the bottom or far right.</li>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Delete</span> from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Columns</span> or <span class="csg-menu">Rows</span> sub-menu as appropriate.
            The columns or rows will be removed from the table.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="changing_column_width" id="changing_column_width"></a>Changing column width</h4>
    <p>
        Tables are usually created with all their columns of equal width.
        However, you may need one or more columns to be wider than the others.
        For example, if you made a table to display students marks in a series of tests,
        you would need a wide column for their names and narrower columns for the marks.
    </p>
    <p>To change column width:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the caret in the column you want to change.
            If you want to change more than one column, select all the columns you want to change by
            putting the caret in the upper leftmost cell and dragging down to the lower rightmost.
        </li>
        <li>Point at the column width marker in the ruler.</li>
        <li>
            When the pointer turns into two vertical lines with arrows pointing out from them,
            click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span> and drag this new pointer along to the place where you want the column to end.
            The status line will give you precise information about the measurement.
        </li>
        <li>The table will now appear with the extended or shrunken column you have altered.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can change the width of part of a column, by selecting only those cells whose width you want to change and following the process outlined above.</p>

    <h4><a name="repositioning_the_table_on_the_page" id="repositioning_the_table_on_the_page"></a>Repositioning the table on the page</h4>
    <p>
        You can alter column widths to reposition the table on the page.
        Tables automatically start in the second column.
        By adjusting the width of the first (leftmost) column on the page,
        you can align your table with your text or margins.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that the column border is displayed.</li>
        <li>
            Select all the rows of the column to the left of the table, as many rows as there are rows in the table.
            This will ensure that it is only the table which is repositioned, and not the rest of your text.
        </li>
        <li>Point at the column width marker for this first column, and drag it to the required position.</li>
        <li>Your table will be repositioned on the page.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="changing_row_height" id="changing_row_height"></a>Changing row height</h4>
    <p>The process for changing row height is exactly like that for changing columns, but uses the side ruler.</p>
    <p>However the height of the entire row will change; you cannot select part of a row and change its height.</p>

    <h4><a name="autowidth_and_autoheight" id="autowidth_and_autoheight"></a>Choosing the width or height for a column or row</h4>
    <p>
        The Auto Width and Auto Height facilities make it possible to
        make columns and rows exactly the right width to contain their largest member.
        Using this facility allows you to tidy up your table.
    </p>
    <p>To use Auto Width:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the column whose width you want to adjust (or individual cells in the column).</li>
        <li>
            Point at the column width marker for the column whose width you want to adjust.
            The pointer will change into double arrows.
        </li>
        <li>Double-click on the column border.</li>
        <li>The column(s) will be resized to the best width according to the widest entry.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The process for setting automatic row height is identical but you should select a row and double-click on its marker.
        This effectively clears the fixed row height setting attached to a row,
        so that the row height will alter automatically to track the tallest paragraph in the row.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="designing_grids_boxes_and_borders" id="designing_grids_boxes_and_borders"></a>Designing grids, boxes and borders</h2>

    <p>
        Most tables are easier to read if there is a pattern of lines, or grid, dividing the columns and rows.
        Fireworkz enables you to design the grid containing the information in your table using the Box editor and the Style editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The grid exists in an space between each cell.
        Each cell also has a border, which is its boundary.
        You can highlight cells, columns and rows by displaying the border.
        Either create a style, based on the table style, or apply an effect to the cells you want to change.
    </p>
    <p>The default style for tables is a black grid surrounding every cell.</p>
    <p>The example and template files in the Examples directory contain several different table styles which you can use in your own document.</p>

    <h3><a name="using_background_colours" id="using_background_colours"></a>Using background colours</h3>
    <p>
        Adding a background colour to a row or column is a good way of emphasising it.
        Background colours are also added using either the Style editor or the Effects command.
    </p>
    <p>To add a background colour to a table style:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a new style based on your existing table style.
            Call it something like <code>Table colour</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Go to the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Colour</span> section of the <span class="csg-dbox">Style</span> dialogue box.</li>
        <li>
            Turn on <span class="csg-dbox-option">Background colour</span>.
            Choose the colour you want for the background, either by
            clickin the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Colour</span> button in this group to use the standard colour selector,
            or by clicking on one of the pre-defined colour buttons in the palette,
            or by typing in RGB values,
            or use the arrows to enter RGB values.
        </li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.</li>
        <li>Select the part of the table you want to appear in the new colour, and apply the <code>Table colour</code> style to it.</li>
        <li>The selected cells will appear in the new colour.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="boxes_and_borders" id="boxes_and_borders"></a>Boxes and borders</h3>
    <p>As the finishing touch to your table or form you may want to add a border or box around some areas of your page.</p>
    <p>
        You may add an external box or internal grid lines to areas of cells or paragraphs.
        You can apply a box style to individual cells, groups of cells, whole tables or whole documents.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="boxes" id="boxes"></a>Boxes</h3>
    <p>Boxes are external lines around a rectangular group of cells or paragraphs.</p>
    <p>
        There are several different line styles available for drawing boxes.
        These are shown in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Line style</span> section of the <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box.
        They are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>invisible (no line);</li>
        <li>narrow lines;</li>
        <li>thin solid lines;</li>
        <li>thick solid lines;</li>
        <li>dotted lines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Setting the size of box lines</h4>
    <p>
        The width of lines used in boxes is based on the width of line set in the
        <span class="csg-dbox-option">Grid width</span> setting of the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Paper</span> dialogue box.
        The thin and dotted lines are the same as this width,
        the narrow line half of this width and the thick line twice this width.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change the setting of the grid width to the width you want in points.
        If you do this, and make the measurement much larger, you should check the text at the beginning and end of paragraphs;
        a large grid width setting could cut into the tops and bottoms of letters
        if there is insufficient paragraph spacing to cover the grid width.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have large text in shallow paragraphs or rows, you may occasionally
        find that the grid is drawn over the tops or bottoms of the letters,
        which you will see as the tops or bottoms of letters being clipped off.
        If you have no grid displayed this will manifest itself as the
        top of the first or bottom of the last lines in paragraphs being missing.
        This problem usually appears on screen.
    </p>
    <p>There are two possible solutions to this problem if it arises:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set the grid width to a smaller size.
            If you do this, remember that the width of lines in boxes and explicitly drawn grids is calculated
            as a proportion of the width of the grid line width set in the <span class="csg-dbox">Paper</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">If you have no visible grids in the document, you can happily set the grid width to zero.</li>
        <li>
            Make your rows or paragraphs slightly deeper, by adding spacing above or below in the

    <p>To add a box:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the area of table that you want to add a box to.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box by choosing <span class="csg-menu-option">Box</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu.</li>
        <li>Select <span class="csg-dbox-option">Outside</span>.</li>
        <li>Choose a line style by clicking on its button in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Line style</span> section of the dialogue box.</li>
        <li>Choose a colour for the box using the colour selection tools.</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
            A box will appear around the edge of the selected area.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="grid_lines" id="grid_lines"></a>Grid lines</h3>
    <p>
        You can add grid lines to any set of selected cells or paragraphs using the <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box.
        The line styles available for grid lines are the same as for boxes.
    </p>
    <p>To do this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the area you want to add the grid to.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box by choosing <span class="csg-menu-option">Box</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Style menu.</span></li>
        <li>
            Select <span class="csg-dbox-option">All</span> to add the line to all sides of
            all cells/paragraphs, or the required combination of vertical and horizontal lines.
        </li>
        <li>Choose the line style and colour for the grid lines.</li>
        <li>
            Click on <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
            The grid lines will be added to the selected area as directed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="boxes_and_the_grid" id="boxes_and_the_grid"></a>Boxes and the grid</h3>
    <p>When you draw a box around a group of cells, it is based on the positioning of the grid between the cells and their neighbours.</p>
    <p>
        If you are creating a complex document, where the width of columns varies as tables and text appear in the document,
        you may encounter some problems with the drawing of boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The simple solution to this is to keep an extra row in the same column format as the table above and below the table.
        These act as a buffer between the table and the rest of the document and ensure that its box is always displayed and printed correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should not encounter this problem where tables are added to documents where the surrounding column is the full width of the page;
        it only occurs when tables are embedded in worksheet type documents with variable column widths.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines" id="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines"></a>Removing boxes and grid lines</h3>
    <p>There are two options for removing boxes, borders and grid lines from tables or from areas within tables.</p>

    <h4><a name="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines_regions" id="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines_regions"></a>Using the Regions editor</h4>
    <p>
        You can use the Regions editor to remove grids and boxes from your documents.
        You can do this because grids, boxes and so on are applied to the document as effects, and are therefore controlled by the Regions editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use the Regions editor to remove a region, it will remove the whole of that grid or box.
        To do this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click in the area containing the grid or box you want to remove.</li>
        <li>Display the <span class="csg-menu">Regions</span> sub-menu from the <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu, and choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Edit</span>.</li>
        <li>
            Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">In</span> or <span class="csg-dbox-button">Out</span> buttons
            until you see that the grid or box you want to remove is described in the status line.
            You will also see that the region containing the grid or box is selected in the document.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you have the right region selected, click <span class="csg-dbox-button">Delete</span>.
            The effect will be removed from the document
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines_transparent" id="removing_boxes_and_grid_lines_transparent"></a>Using the transparent/invisible option</h4>
    <p>A much more flexible option for editing the grids and boxes in tables or elsewhere in documents is to use the transparent/invisible line facility in the Box editor.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the table or the part of the table or document from which you want to remove the line, grid or box.</li>
        <li>Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Box</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            Set up the box editor so that it affects the lines you want to change,
            for example if you want to remove a box from outside a selection of cells you would choose <span class="csg-dbox-option">Outside</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Click the Line style button representing transparent/invisible (this is the button with no marking on it).</li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            The table should be redrawn with the lines you selected no longer displayed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="entering_text_into_tables" id="entering_text_into_tables"></a>Entering text into tables</h2>

    <h3><a name="typing_directly_into_tables" id="typing_directly_into_tables"></a>Typing directly into tables</h3>
    <p>
        To type directly into a table, place the caret in the cell you want to type in and enter your text.
        This will enter the information as text.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Text typed into cells will automatically flow on to a new line if necessary,
            creating a deeper cell, unless Fixed row height is turned on.
            In this case the row height will not automatically expand to compensate for this,
            and you will need to accommodate the extra text by making the column wider
            or the row deeper using the row and column borders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Return&crarr;</span> to start a new line within a cell.
            If you have several words to enter within a cell
            (perhaps a list of items, or parts of an address)
            this lets you ensure that each starts on a new line.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move between cells.
            Or press <span class="csg-key">Tab</span>,
            <span class="csg-key">Shift-Tab</span> or <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Tab</span> to move around the table.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="entering_numerical_live_data_into_tables" id="entering_numerical_live_data_into_tables"></a>Entering numerical live data into tables</h4>
    <p>
        You may enter data into tables in Fireworkz as data, via the editing line.
        This makes the data live and enables you to perform calculations upon it.
        To enter live data in a cell:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the cell.</li>
        <li>
            Press <span class="csg-key">F2 </span>or click in the formula line.
            The caret will appear in the formula line.
        </li>
        <li>Type in the number or data, or enter a formula.</li>
        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/tick.png" alt="Tick tool button" />
            Click the <span class="csg-key">Tick</span> tool button on the toolbar
            (or press <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>)
            to confirm the data and enter it in the cell.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="using_styles_and_effects_in_tables" id="using_styles_and_effects_in_tables"></a>Using styles and effects in tables</h3>
    <p>Text will appear in the main text style of your document, with the margins defined in the Table style, but you can modify that style to suit.</p>
    <p>Useful points to consider are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider using a <strong>sans-serif</strong> font, such as Homerton (RISC OS) or Arial (Windows), which is easier to read.</li>
        <li>Emphasise any title rows and/or columns by using bold text rather than capitals as this provides emphasis without lessening readability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Grid patterns and background colours are also defined as styles.
        Remember that you can apply more than one style to an area if different attributes are set in each style.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should define grids and background colours as separate styles to the main table style you are using for the table.
        This makes it much easier to change the look of the table without altering the basic way it is laid out.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="importing_data_into_tables" id="importing_data_into_tables"></a>Importing data into tables</h3>
    <p>Rather than type your data directly into the table, you may want to import the data from another source and place it directly in the cells of a table.</p>
    <p>Data for import should be in CSV format.</p>
    <p>Drag the CSV file icon on to the document window, or on Windows, choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert file</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.</p>
    <p>A dialogue box will appear presenting the following options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Insert, overwriting blank cells</strong>.
            This simply places the data in a blank area of the worksheet.
            If not enough cells are blank, rows are inserted.
            This option is only useful for worksheet documents;
            you should use the following option in letter documents,
            unless you are importing the CSV file into an existing table.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Insert as a table</strong>.
            This is the default option which is normally selected when you start loading CSV files.
            This option creates a table within the document at the place where you dropped the file icon.
            The table will be the correct size for the file you import.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Insert as labels</strong>.
            This gives you the option of creating mailing labels from a suitable file.
            Each row is turned into a label, with each column becoming a single line.
            You can specify the number of labels across the page.
            Use the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Fixed row height</span> option in the Style editor to make the labels on screen the right size for printing on to labels.
            See the section on printing labels.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you added the file as a table, use the Style editor to turn grid lines and background colours on or off as required.</p>
    <p>Edit the table layout in the usual way.</p>
