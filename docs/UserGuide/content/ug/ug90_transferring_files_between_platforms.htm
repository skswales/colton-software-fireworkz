    <p>
        You may wish to transfer documents between RISC OS and Windows.
        Fireworkz documents can easily be transferred between the two platforms,
        but there are some potential problems which you should watch out for.
    </p>
    <p>Before copying the file to another system, you should check for the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#transferring_files_between_platforms_fonts">Fonts (transferring)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures">Pictures and charts (transferring)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then proceed to transfer the files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#transferring_files_from_risc_os_to_windows">Transferring files from RISC OS to Windows</a></li>

        <li><a href="#transferring_files_from_windows_to_risc_os.htm">Transferring files from Windows to RISC OS</a></li>

        <li><a href="#transferring_files_with_emulated_risc_os">Transferring files to and from RISC OS under emulation</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="transferring_files_between_platforms_fonts" id="transferring_files_between_platforms_fonts"></a>Fonts (transferring)</h2>

    <h3>Names</h3>
    <p>
        Fireworkz stores the fonts used in documents internally by their PostScript name,
        if one is known, rather than any platform- or other vendor-specific name.
        If most of the fonts you use on both platforms are standard fonts with standard PostScript names,
        you should find that the correct fonts are used.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, documents which use the RISC OS fonts Trinity and Homerton
        will be displayed in Times and Helvetica respectively if those fonts are installed,
        or Times New Roman and Arial if only the minimum Windows fonts are present.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your documents use non-standard fonts which do not have a direct equivalent on your other systems,
        another font will be used. Inevitably, this will mean that your text is reformatted.
    </p>

    <h3>Height and width</h3>
    <p>
        Fireworkz allows you to stretch and shrink type using the Width option in the Text section of the Style editor.
        Unfortunately, if this option has been set in RISC OS, it will mean that Windows may not display the text at the correct height or width.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ideally, you should turn this option off in all text before transferring files.
        If you do not, you may find that text is displayed at the height which matches the width which has been entered.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures" id="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures"></a>Pictures and charts (transferring)</h2>

    <p>
        Charts and pictures which are embedded within documents will be
        transferred along with the text and the rest of the document.
        Fireworkz will interpret and display most embedded picture files,
        and also more complex pictures such as pictogram charts which are effectively
        a Draw file containing embedded sprites or further Draw files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Referenced pictures will usually be transferred or translated.
        However, you must first make sure that the file names of referenced pictures can be understood by both systems.
        You will also need to make sure that in both the original and the copy that all the files are in the same directory:
        this makes it much easier for Fireworkz to find the files.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="transferring_files_from_risc_os_to_windows" id="transferring_files_from_risc_os_to_windows"></a>Transferring files from RISC OS to Windows</h2>

    <p>
        The process of transferring files to Windows is quite simple.
        The work needs to be done at the RISC OS end,
        so if you are going to be sent files and do not have access to an RISC OS computer,
        make sure that the person sending the files has a copy of this chapter and follows the instructions.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Check the document for any of the pitfalls outlined above.</li>

        <li>
            Save the file in a location which your Windows computer can access
            (for example on a DOS format floppy disc, or on a network server accessible to both types of machine).
        </li>

        <li>
            You will need to rename the file and change its type.
            Select the file in the directory display on the RISC OS desktop.
            Press <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> (the middle mouse button) and choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Set Type</span> from the menu which appears.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the extension <code>/FWK</code>, for example <code>FILENAME/FWK</code>.
            This will be interpreted by Windows as <code>FILENAME.FWK</code>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can now take the file to a Windows computer.</p>

    <h2><a name="transferring_files_from_windows_to_risc_os" id="transferring_files_from_windows_to_risc_os"></a>Transferring files from Windows to RISC OS</h2>

    <p>To transfer files from Windows to RISC OS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Save the file in a location which your RISC OS computer can access
            (for example on a DOS format floppy disc, or on a network server accessible to both types of machine).
        </li>

        <li>Select the file in the directory display on the RISC OS desktop.</li>

        <li>Press <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> (the middle mouse button) and choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Set Type</span> from the menu which appears.</li>

        <li>Change the file type to <code>Firewrkz</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You will now be able to use the file in RISC OS.</p>
    <p>Note that the same issues with font transfer affect Windows to RISC OS file transfers.</p>

    <h2><a name="transferring_files_with_emulated_risc_os" id="transferring_files_with_emulated_risc_os"></a>Transferring files to and from RISC OS under emulation</h2>

    <p>
        If you use VirtualRPC you can ease the filename mapping process somewhat.
        In Windowed mode, go to Tools &ndash; Options and alter the list of HostFS Extensions.
        Add a mapping between RISC OS file type "BDF" (Fireworkz) and DOS extension "fwk".
        To transfer Fireworkz template files,
        add a mapping between RISC OS file type "C1D" (Fireworkz templates) and DOS extension "fwt".
