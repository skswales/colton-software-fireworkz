    <h2>About Fireworkz</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz is part of the Z family of applications from Colton Software.
        It is compatible with documents created in other members of this family such as
        Fireworkz Pro (as Fireworkz, but with additional database facilities) and the earlier
        Wordz (a stand-alone word processing application) and
        Resultz (a stand-alone spreadsheet application).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use Fireworkz as a word processor to write letters,
        reports, books, invitations, shopping lists, schedules and other
        documents.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use Fireworkz as a spreadsheet to perform calculations,
        analyse figures, and produce colourful charts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fireworkz further combines these two functions enabling you to do even more
        that you could with separate word processing and spreadsheet applications -
        incorporate live results in your reports, or
        automatic mail-merge to your friends or customers, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have learned how to use Fireworkz on one platform,
        RISC OS for instance, you should find it easy to use on any other platform,
        such as Windows, as it has been designed to be as similar as possible on each platform.
    </p>

    <h2>About this <em>User Guide</em></h2>

    <h3>What you need to use Fireworkz</h3>
    <p>
        This <em>User Guide</em> assumes that you are already reasonably familiar with the way your computer works.
        If you are new to computing, or to RISC OS or Windows,
        you are advised to familiarise yourself both with the
        relevant terminology and the basics of using your computer.
        You will need to know how to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start programs and open documents;</li>
        <li>Display menus and choose entries from them;</li>
        <li>Access discs, view directories, and copy files using the Filer (RISC OS) or File Explorer (Windows);</li>
        <li>
            RISC OS: Position windows on screen and change their size using the
            title bar, back icon, toggle size icon and adjust size icon;
        </li>
        <li>
            Windows: Position windows on screen and change their size,
            minimise and restore windows;
        </li>
        <li>Scroll through documents using scroll bars and arrows;</li>
        <li>
            Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen and to
            display and position the caret, and how to use the mouse
            buttons to click, double-click, and drag objects.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should understand terms such as directory, double-click, and dialogue box.</p>
    <p>
        You will find all this information in the <em>RISC OS User Guide</em>
        and Windows documentation provided with your computer.
    </p>
    <p>The tutorial chapters in the <em>Getting Started Guide</em> also provide a reminder of these skills.</p>
    <p>
        Technical terms used in this guide are explained when they first appear,
        and in the <a href="../ug/ug98_glossary.htm">Glossary</a> at the end.
        However, you should also refer to the documenation which came with your computer
        for the basic vocabulary used to describe parts of your computer and
        the tasks you can do with it.
    </p>

    <h3>What you will learn from this <em>User Guide</em></h3>
    <p>
        This <em>User Guide</em> provides a complete reference for all the
        menu commands, dialogue boxes and on-screen buttons in Fireworkz,
        so that if you have any questions while you are doing
        your own work you will quickly be able to find the answer.
    </p>
    <p>Separate sections cover each subject in detail.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will find that some topics need to be covered separately for
            RISC OS and Windows versions of Fireworkz.
            Where this happens, a clearly labelled sub-section
            describes the relevant information for each type of computer.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            This only usually happens where there is a specific difference in the way that
            these operating systems require the program to operate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Text in this <em>User Guide</em></h3>
    <p>
        When working your way through this <em>User Guide</em>,
        you will see that certain stylistic conventions are used to make it easier
        for you to see what you should type in and what you should choose from menus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain buttons, options and commands always appear in the text in bold type.
        These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Menu options.
            For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> command from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            Action and option buttons in dialogue boxes.
            For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span> button.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/style.png" alt="Style tool button">
            Tool buttons on the toolbar.
            For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> tool button on the toolbar.&rsquo;<br />
            To the left, you also see a representation of that tool button.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In some places there is text for you to type in.
        This is always shown in a typewriter-style font, like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="csg-user-text">Type this text on your computer exactly as you see it.</blockquote>
    <p>
        When the text given represents what you will type,
        for example, the name to be given to a file before saving it,
        this is shown by using italics, such as:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Type <span class="csg-user-text"><var>filename</var></span> in the dialogue box which appears.</blockquote>

    <h3>RISC OS conventions used in this <em>User Guide</em></h3>
    <p>
        There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your computer,
        the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry out.
    </p>

    <h4>The mouse</h4>
    <p>
        The three buttons on your mouse each perform separate functions,
        and their names reflect this.
        Their names are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Left mouse button: <strong>Select</strong></li>
        <li>Middle mouse button: <strong>Menu</strong></li>
        <li>Right mouse button: <strong>Adjust</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Many actions using the mouse are performed by <strong>clicking</strong> or
        <strong>double-clicking</strong> an object.
        To do this, position the pointer over the required object
        (e.g. the Fireworkz application icon) and press and release
        <strong>Select</strong> (the left mouse button) once or twice respectively.
        As the <em>User Guide</em> covers both RISC OS and Windows,
        <strong>Select</strong> will generally be referred to as
        '<span>Select</span> (the left mouse button)' in the following chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing <strong>Menu</strong> (the middle mouse button)
        with the pointer inside a Fireworkz window displays the main menu,
        from which you may choose an option by pointing at it and
        clicking with <strong>Select</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Adjust</strong> (the right mouse button)
        can be used to access some short-cuts and more sophisticated functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Windows conventions used in this <em>User Guide</em></h3>
    <p>
        There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your computer,
        the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry out.
    </p>

    <h4>The mouse</h4>
    <p>
        Fireworkz on Windows uses the left button of the mouse
        (or its equivalent on alternative pointing device which you use, such as a trackpad).
        When you are called to click on an object, this means click and release the left button of the mouse.
        As the <em>User Guide</em> covers both RISC OS and Windows,
        the left mouse button will often be referred to as
        '<span>Select</span> (the left mouse button)' in the following chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some special operations you will need to press the
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Fireworkz was designed in the early 1990s,
        the right mouse button was reserved for use by OLE,
        and has since been used for context menus.
        Fireworkz does not use this mouse button on Windows.
    </p>

    <h4>File locations</h4>
    <p>
        When Fireworkz is installed on Windows, by default it will be installed in the directory<br />
        <code>%ProgramFiles%\Colton Software\Fireworkz</code><br />
        where <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> corresponds to the
        <code>Program Files</code> directory on your system drive.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Fireworkz is a 32-bit application, when installed on a 64-bit system
        <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> is replaced by <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%</code>
        (i.e. the <code>Program Files (x86)</code> directory on your system drive),
        although the former is used for consistency throughout the <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>The Examples directory</h3>
    <p>
        The <em>User Guide</em> occasionally refers to the Examples directory.
        The Examples directory is provided in the Fireworkz Pro package,
        and also in the Fireworkz for Windows package alongside the Fireworkz installer,
        but must be installed separately for Fireworkz on RISC OS if you wish to access its contents &mdash;
        please see the Installation chapter in the <em>Getting Started Guide</em>.
