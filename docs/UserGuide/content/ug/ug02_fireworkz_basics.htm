    <h1><a name="fireworkz_basics" id="fireworkz_basics"></a><span class="csg-chapter-number">2 </span>Fireworkz basics</h1>

    <p>
        This chapter describes the various features of Fireworkz which
        enable you to control it, such as menus, dialogue boxes and
        control key shortcuts. It gives you a tour of the Fireworkz
        document window and the controls it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Descriptions are given for both the RISC OS and Windows
        versions of Fireworkz. You will see that as much as the two
        different operating environments allow, the two are designed to
        be as similar as possible, helping users who need to use both
        versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This chapter also shows you how to customise the on-screen look
        of Fireworkz so that you can set up the
        program to show you the details you want to see at the size that
        works best for you on your screen and computer.
    </p>
    <p>It includes sections on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#the_fireworkz_document_window">The Fireworkz document window</a></li>
        <li><a href="#the_toolbar">The toolbar</a></li>
        <li><a href="#the_status_line">The status line</a></li>
        <li><a href="#menus">Menus</a></li>
        <li><a href="#dialogue_boxes">Dialogue boxes</a></li>
        <li><a href="#customising_the_look_of_the_program">View control and scale</a></li>
        <li><a href="#the_ruler">The ruler</a></li>
        <li><a href="#displaying_paper_and_borders">Paper and borders</a></li>
        <li><a href="#choices_dialogue_box">Choices dialogue box</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="the_fireworkz_document_window" id="the_fireworkz_document_window"></a>Using Fireworkz</h2>

    <p>When you are using Fireworkz you will need to issue it with a variety of commands (instructions), so that it does what you want.</p>
    <p>
        Most <b>commands</b> can be accessed through menus;
        some of the choices on <b>menus</b> lead to
        simple or detailed <a href="#dialogue_boxes"><b>dialogue boxes</b></a>
        into which you can type your preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actions you need to perform most frequently in processing your documents
        can be accessed from the <a href="#the_toolbar"><b>toolbar</b></a>,
        where each is represented by an icon button.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="the_document_window" id="the_document_window"></a>The document window</h3>
    <p>
        When you use Fireworkz to create a new document or load an
        existing document, the document will appear in a window on your desktop.
        For example:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="../common/images/the_13.png" alt="Example document window" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" />
    </p>
    <p>
        The central area in white represents the paper onto which you can enter your document.
        Anything inside this area will appear when your document is printed, anything outside this area will not appear.
    </p>
    <p>The other areas of the window are explained briefly below.</p>

    <h3><a name="the_title_bar" id="the_title_bar"></a>The title bar</h3>
    <p>The title bar of your document window includes some helpful information about your document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have saved the document, its full file and path name is shown.</li>
        <li>
            If the document is new, the name of the template on which it is based is shown.
            (Templates are used to defined how a document will be displayed -
            some templates are provided with Fireworkz and you can create others yourself.)
        </li>
        <li>If the document has been modified since it was last saved, an asterisk will be displayed.</li>
        <li>
            If you have a number of open windows belonging to the same document,
            the title of the document will contain a numeral indicating the number of views.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the document is not being viewed at full size (i.e. at a scale other than 100%),
            the scale being used in that view will be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="the_toolbar" id="the_toolbar"></a>The toolbar</h3>
    <p>
        Many word processing and editing tasks are simple and repetitive,
        so Fireworkz offers you a quick way of performing them,
        and saves you from having to hunt for the command on the menu or remember a complicated key shortcut.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the top of the document window is a toolbar containing a row of icons, called tool buttons.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="../common/images/toolbar/tbar.png" alt="Toolbar" style="border: 1px solid #EEE" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on a button performs a specific task,
        such as justifying the selected paragraph,
        changing the selected text to bold or
        cutting and pasting selected text.
        Tool buttons which are currently in use look as if they have been pressed in.
        Tool buttons which are not available for use in the current context are disabled and appear greyed out.
    </p>
    <p>
        The toolbar also enables you to set tabs, and to apply
        <a href="../ug/ug05_working_with_styles_and_effects.htm">styles</a> and
        <a href="../ug/ug05_working_with_styles_and_effects.htm#effects">effects</a>
        to selected text or at the caret.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="the_status_line" id="the_status_line"></a>The status line</h3>
    <p>
        The status line is an area of the document window dedicated to
        giving you help and information about the work in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you move the mouse pointer (without clicking) over control areas of the window,
        such as the toolbar, a message appears explaining the function of the button.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you drag tab and paragraph markers in the ruler,
        the precise measurements of the place where you have clicked are shown in the selected unit of measurement,
        enabling you to align text and paragraphs precisely.
    </p>
    <p>The status line gives information about spreadsheet functions and operators as you select them from lists.</p>
    <p>
        The results of certain operations, such as style/effect region counts and word counts,
        are displayed on the status line until the mouse pointer is moved again.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="the_ruler" id="the_ruler"></a>The ruler</h3>
    <p>
        The horizontal top ruler appears by default in all letter documents.
        You may also choose to display a vertical ruler,
        using the <a href="#accessing_the_view_control_dialogue_box"><span class="csg-dbox">View control</span></a> dialogue box described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        In documents where no rulers are displayed (usually spreadsheet documents)
        you can turn on the rulers using the <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
        As well as measurement markings the top ruler shows you the left, paragraph and right margins and tabs.
        Use the status line to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ruler is marked out in inches, millimetres or centimetres.
        Change the unit of measurement using the commands on the Extra menu.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="menus" id="menus"></a>Menus</h3>
    <p>A <strong>menu</strong> is a list of commands and other choices from which you can choose an option.</p>
    <p>
        RISC OS: The menus in Fireworkz appear when you click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Menu</span> (the middle mouse button),
        enabling you to choose commands from them as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Windows: The menus in Fireworkz appear at the top of each document window enabling you to choose commands from them as necessary.</p>
    <p>
        Some menu entries include an arrow leading to a sub-menu from which you should make your choice.
        Others include a keyboard short cut which enables you to bypass the menu entirely.
        This is shown by a short cut code next to the menu entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Windows: You can also select entries from menus by typing in the underlined letter from the option text
        whilst holding down <span class="csg-key">Alt</span>.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="dialogue_boxes" id="dialogue_boxes"></a>Dialogue boxes</h3>
    <p>
        You can navigate dialogue boxes in several different ways.
        The main features of dialogue boxes are shown below:
    </p>
    <p>Using the mouse, click on sections of the dialogue box you want to edit.</p>
    <p>
        Move through the dialogue box using the <span class="csg-key">Tab</span> key.
        This highlights each section in turn, allowing you to make a choice and type in your entry.
        <span class="csg-key">Shift-Tab</span> may be used to move backwards through the dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Windows: If the title of a section, or an option, contains an underlined letter,
        holding down the <span class="csg-key">Alt</span> key whilst typing that letter moves you straight to that section,
        and in the case of options, turns them on as well.
        If an underlined letter appears in an action button,
        <span class="csg-key">Alt-<var>letter</var></span> will act as if that button had been clicked.
        For example, typing <span class="csg-key">Alt-A</span> would take you to the Above paragraph spacing option
        in the Style editor dialogue box, and turn it on if it was turned off.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="customising_the_look_of_the_program" id="customising_the_look_of_the_program"></a>Customising the look of Fireworkz</h2>
    <p>
        Use the <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> and <span class="csg-dbox">View scale</span> dialogue boxes
        to customise the on-screen look of Fireworkz within a document window.
    </p>
    <p>
        Settings chosen with the <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> and
        <span class="csg-dbox">View scale</span> dialogue boxes apply to the current document;
        if you have a particular setting you prefer,
        set up a document <a href="../ug/ug03_creating_new_documents.htm#templates">template</a>
        which includes your chosen settings.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="accessing_the_view_control_dialogue_box" id="accessing_the_view_control_dialogue_box"></a>Accessing the View Control dialogue box</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/view_c.png" alt="View tool button" />
        To access the <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box,
        click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">View</span> tool button at the far left of the toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box will appear.
        Its various sections let you customise the view of your document.
        See:
    </p>

    <h4><a name="displaying_paper_and_borders" id="displaying_paper_and_borders"></a>Displaying paper and borders</h4>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Display</span> section of the
        <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box
        contains a set of radio buttons allowing you to choose which area is displayed in the window.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Full</span> displays the
            full area including printable area, paper and gap between pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Printable area</span> displays the
            printable area of the page including headers and footers, but not the paper margins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Work area</span> displays the
            main body of the page but does not include headers and footers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Click the required radio button and then click the
        <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span> button.
        The view will immediately change in the document.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="rulers_and_borders" id="rulers_and_borders"></a>Rulers and borders</h4>
    <p>
        Depending on the type of document you are editing,
        you may want different measurement markers on display in rulers around the edge of the document,
        possibly in conjunction with either the column or row borders.
        You may have as many or as few of these displayed as you wish;
        they are helpful for designing pages, setting margins and formatting tables.
        The default setting in letter documents is that the top ruler is displayed;
        in sheet documents that the row and column borders are displayed.
    </p>
    <p>If switched on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Top ruler</span> option button displays the horizontal ruler along the top edge of the document.</li>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Side ruler</span> option button displays the vertical ruler down the left-hand edge of the document.</li>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Column border</span> option button displays the column border along the top edge of the document.</li>
        <li>The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Row border</span> option button displays the row border down the left-hand edge of the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="accessing_the_view_scale_dialogue_box" id="accessing_the_view_scale_dialogue_box"></a>Accessing the <span class="csg-windows-title-case">View scale</span> dialogue box</h3>
    <p>
        You may view the document you are working on at different sizes.
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/view_c.png" alt="View tool button" />
        To access the <span class="csg-dbox">View scale</span> dialogue box,
        click <span class="csg-mouse-button">Adjust</span> (RISC OS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) on the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">View</span> button
        at the far left of the toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>The <span class="csg-dbox">View scale</span> dialogue box will appear.</p>
    <p>
        The default scale is 100%, that is the actual size of the text and paper.
        You may change this in one of three ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click one of the numbered buttons to view the document at the given percentage size.</li>
        <li>
            Click repeatedly on the up and down arrow buttons to scale the value
            given in the dialogue box up and down in five per cent gradations,
            or type a new value directly into the space.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the button labelled
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Fit Horz</span> to make the document window
            as wide as possible on the screen and display the document within it
            at the largest possible size which shows you its full width.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Whichever procedure you follow, click
        <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span> in the dialogue box to confirm your choice.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="choosing_the_ruler_measurement" id="choosing_the_ruler_measurement"></a>Choosing the ruler measurement</h4>
    <p>
        You may have the ruler marked in one of several scales;
        one of inches, millimetres, or centimetres.
        Inches may be divided in quarters, eighths, tenths or sixteenths.
    </p>
    <p>To choose the measurement:</p>
    <p>
        Display the <span class="csg-menu">Extra</span> menu, and slide off the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Ruler</span> or <span class="csg-menu-option">Side ruler</span> option,
        depending on which you want to change.
    </p>
    <p>Select a measurement from the list.</p>
    <p>
        The ruler will display your chosen measurement and it will also be
        the measurement used in <a href="#dialogue_boxes">dialogue boxes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the <a href="#choices_dialogue_box">Choices</a> dialogue box to set
        the <a href="#default_ruler">default ruler</a> measurement for new documents.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="splitting_the_view" id="splitting_the_view"></a>Splitting the view</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes you may find it useful to display two separate parts of a document at once, within the same window.
        This is useful if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need to cut and paste items from one end of a long document to the other.</li>
        <li>You want to use a row or column for titles or categories at the top or left of the screen, in a spreadsheet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To set up split views:</p>
    <p>Display the <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box.</p>
    <p>
        Switch on the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Vertical split</span> option button to divide the window vertically.
        You might want to do this if you were comparing one part of your document with another or cutting and pasting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Switch on the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Horizontal split</span> option button to divide the window horizontally.
        You might want to do this if you have a very wide table.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span> button in the dialogue box.
        The screen will be displayed with your chosen view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the scroll bars and arrows for each view to move to the parts of the document you want to display.
        You can also resize each half of the window independently using the Adjust size icon.
    </p>

    <h4>Splitting the view on screen (Windows)</h4>
    <p>
        You can split the screen by selecting and dragging the split marker.
        Simply:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Point to the area just above the top of the vertical scroll bar or to the left of the horizontal scroll bar.
            You will see the pointer change into a bar with an arrow pointing from either side.
        </li>
        <li>Drag the pointer to the place in the window where you want the split to be.</li>
        <li>
            You can point to the split line and move it,
            and independently scroll the two portions of the window.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        To close the split, point to it and drag it back up to the edge of the top or leftmost scroll bar.
        The single editing window will be restored.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="new_view" id="new_view"></a>New view</h3>
    <p>To create a new window on a document:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose the <span class="csg-menu-option">New view</span> option from the <span class="csg-menu">View</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            A new document window will appear; both windows will have a number 2 in the title bar
            to show that there are two windows open on the same document.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Changes made in one window will appear immediately in the other windows open on the same document.</p>

    <h2><a name="choices_dialogue_box" id="choices_dialogue_box"></a>Choices dialogue box</h2>

    <p>
        There are some settings in Fireworkz which you will want set in every document you produce.
        They relate to the way you use Fireworkz rather than to individual documents you work on.
    </p>
    <p>
        These choices are made using the <span class="csg-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box,
        which is accessed from the icon bar menu (RISC OS) or
        from the <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu (Windows).

        <li>
            Display the <span class="csg-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box by choosing
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Choices</span> from the icon bar (RISC OS) or
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> (Windows) menu.
        </li>
        <li>Type in the number of minutes you want between each automatic save.</li>
        <li>All open and modified Fireworkz documents will now be saved automatically at the interval you have specified.</li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            If a document has not already been saved once you will see a dialogue box in which
            you should name the document and click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">If the document has been saved the Auto save process is automatic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember that Auto save can be very destructive, as well as useful.
        If you often change your mind about text in your document, you should be wary of this feature.
        You might want to go back to an older version of the file, only to find that Auto save has just overwritten it.
        Either set Auto save to off, or save a copy of the document under a different name at the start of an editing session.
        Auto save will overwrite this version, and your original will not be overwritten.

    <h3><a name="dithering" id="dithering"></a>Allow dithering</h3>
    <p>
        This option is only available on Windows.
        If you use dithered colours, pictures will be displayed in colours closer to their true colours on 16 colour displays.
        If you do not use dithered colours, the nearest solid colour will be substituted.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="display_pictures" id="display_pictures"></a>Display pictures</h3>
    <p>
        This option turns the display of pictures in a document on or off.
        If the option button is switched on, pictures will be displayed.
        You may wish not to have pictures displayed while you are editing the document in order to scroll through the document more quickly.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="embed_pictures" id="embed_pictures"></a>Embed pictures</h3>
    <p>
        Usually pictures are <b>embedded</b> in documents so that when you save the document,
        a copy of the picture is saved as part of it.
        You may prefer to have the picture <b>referenced</b> by your documents.
        The main advantage of this is that it saves hard disc space.
        But referencing has the disadvantage that it is harder to move documents around.
    </p>
    <p>To reference pictures, turn the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Embed pictures</span> option off.</p>
    <p>For more details on using pictures, see the <em><a href="../ug/ug10_pictures.htm">Pictures</a></em> section.</p>

    <h3><a name="charts_options" id="charts_options"></a>Charts</h3>
    <p>
        This option lets you switch off the automatic update of charts within documents.
        If you do this, your charts will not be updated when the data on which they are based changes.
        You may want to turn this option off to speed up the processing of your data,
        and then turn it back on at the end of an editing session.
