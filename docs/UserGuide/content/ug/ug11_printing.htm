        The end result of most of your work with Fireworkz will be a printed document.
        It is therefore worth spending some time exploring the various printing options available,
        and making sure that your computer and printer are set up to get the best possible results.

    <h2><a name="before_printing" id="before_printing"></a>Before printing</h2>

    <p>Before trying to print, ensure that your printer is correctly set up, loaded with paper and cartridge or ribbon, and is switched on and set on-line.</p>
    <p>
        Fireworkz uses the standard RISC OS or Windows printer drivers for printing.
        You should make sure that you have loaded the printer driver that you want to use.
        If you have more than one printer driver installed make sure that you have selected the one that you want to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also make sure that your printer driver is correctly configured.
        To do this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            On RISC OS, load the printer manager by double-clicking on the !Printers icon in Apps.
            Then double-click on your printer's entry in the <span class="csg-dbox">Printer control</span> window
            which is available from the <span class="csg-menu">Printer</span> icon bar menu.
            The <span class="csg-dbox">Printer configuration</span> dialogue box will be displayed;
            refer to the <em>RISC OS User Guide</em>, in conjunction with the documentation for your printer,
            for full details of this process and what to do to fine-tune your printer driver.
        </li>
        <li>
            On Windows, you can use the <span class="csg-menu-option">Print Setup</span> dialogue box from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu to help set up the printer driver to print the document as you want.
            Consult your operating system and your printer documentation for further details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="printing" id="printing"></a>Printing</h2>

    <h3><a name="choosing_to_print" id="choosing_to_print"></a>Choosing to print</h3>
    <p>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/print.png" alt="Print tool button" />
        Once you are ready to print, display the <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box
        by clicking on the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Print</span> tool button on the toolbar
        (or by choosing <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu).
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box is
        where you make important choices about your printing job,
        such as how many copies of the document you want to print,
        or what selection of pages from the document you want to print.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="basic_print_options" id="basic_print_options"></a>Basic printing options</h3>
    <p>
        When you choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> from a menu or the toolbar,
        the basic <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box will appear.
        It will show you the type of printer driver you have loaded (e.g. PostScript):
        on RISC OS this will be shown at the top of the dialogue box, whereas
        on Windows this will be shown in the title bar.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the number of copies of your document that you want to print.</li>
        <li>
            If you only want to print some of the pages in your document,
            select the <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Range</span> radio button.
            You will then be able to type in the number of the page you want to start printing from,
            and the number of the last page in the range you want to print.
            The basic <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box allows you
            to select pages going down the document (Y - where one is the topmost page)
            and pages going across the document (X - where one is the leftmost page).
            If the <span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Range</span> radio button is not selected, the Range options will be greyed out.
        </li>
        <li>Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Print</span></span> to print.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="extra_print_options" id="extra_print_options"></a>Additional printing options</h3>
    <p>
        Several extra options are available for more advanced printing requirements.
        To access them, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Extra</span> button in the <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box.
        A larger dialogue box containing a wider range of options will appear.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="range_of_pages" id="range_of_pages"></a>Range of pages</h4>
    <p>
        You will see that the range numbers in the large <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box dialogue box run from 1.1 onwards.
        This is because Fireworkz can handle documents which are more than one page wide, such as large tables.
    </p>
    <p>
        Page number x.y means the x-th page across and the y-th page down.
        Normally you will only have one page across and so the first number will always be one.
        In this case you can miss out the 1. when editing range information.
    </p>
    <p>You can specify a list, a range or a combination of the two.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <div class="csg-page-padding-left">
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col style="min-width: 8em;" />
                <col />
            </colgroup>
            <tbody class="csg-table-align-top">
                <tr>
                    <td class="csg-user-text" style="width: 8em;">2 4 7</td>
                    <td>Prints pages 2, 4 and 7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="csg-user-text">1 3-5 8</td>
                    <td>Prints pages 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="csg-user-text">2.1-2.7</td>
                    <td>Prints the first seven pages of the second column</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="csg-user-text">B 1</td>
                    <td>Prints a blank page and then the first page (pamphlet printing)</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>
        Your list can be several lines long.
        To add more lines press <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Return&crarr;</span>.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="pamphlet_printing" id="pamphlet_printing"></a>Pamphlet printing</h4>
    <p>
        The pamphlet printing option enables you to print documents which will be folded and stapled to produce an A5 pamphlet.
        For example in an eight page document page one will be printed next to page eight, page two next to page seven, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        To switch on pamphlet printing, click the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Pamphlet</span> button.
        You will see that the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Two up</span> option button has been switched on as well,
        and that the Range list box contains a list of pages showing you the pairs of pages that will appear on each printed page.
        <code>B</code> means a blank page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pamphlet printing assumes that you have a duplex printer,
        i.e. one which automatically feeds the pages back through to print on the reverse side.
        If this is not the case:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Delete every alternate line (representing a pair of pages) from the Range list box,
            by selecting the entries and pressing <span class="csg-key">Delete</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Print the remaining pages.</li>
        <li>Reload the paper into the printer the correct way round.</li>
        <li>Choose Pamphlet printing again and delete the pages you have already printed.</li>
        <li>
            If necessary, switch on <span class="csg-dbox-option">Reverse</span> printing as well.
            The aim is to get page two to appear on the back of page one.
            You may need to experiment to get your pages in the right order and the correct orientation.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="sides" id="sides"></a>Sides</h4>
    <p>Click on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Both</span> to print all pages;</li>
        <li><span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Odd</span> to print odd pages;</li>
        <li><span class="csg-dbox-option-value">Even</span> to print even pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first page in a document is always an odd page.</p>

    <h4><a name="reverse_printing" id="reverse_printing"></a>Reverse</h4>
    <p>This option prints pages in reverse order, i.e. last page first.</p>

    <h4><a name="collated" id="collated"></a>Collated</h4>
    <p>
        If you are printing more than one copy of a document this option will collate them
        so that the pages appear as complete documents rather than all the page ones then all the page twos.
        However it can add considerably to printing time, as some printers, particularly laser printers,
        can print multiple copies of a single page much more quickly than a single copy of several different pages.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="two_up" id="two_up"></a>Two up</h4>
    <p>
        This option prints two reduced size pages side-by-side on an A4 page.
        This will be page 1 and page 2 of the document, and subsequent pairs of pages.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you want to print two-up copies of a single page document,
            simply copy the whole document and paste the copy on to a second page
            (force a page break using the <span class="csg-dbox">Pages</span> dialogue box if necessary).
            Then when you print two-up you will print two copies of the same page.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="print_scale" id="print_scale"></a>Print scale</h3>
    <p>
        This option lets you set the size of your printed output in terms of
        a percentage of the actual size of the document (i.e. you can print reduced or enlarged document content),
        or so that the printed output will fit on the selected size of paper.
        To set this:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Scale</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">Page</span> menu.
            The <span class="csg-menu-option">Print scale</span> dialogue box will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select the options required from the <span class="csg-dbox">Print scale</span> dialogue box.
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
                <li>
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-button">Fit one page</span> button will fit all of your document on to one page of paper,
                    reducing or enlarging as necessary.
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Scale</span> option will show the scale that will be applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-button">Fit one page across</span> button will do the same, but only across the paper:
                    the document will have as many Y pages as are needed.
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Scale</span> option will show the scale that will be applied.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-button">100%</span> button will set the document to print at its true size.
                    You can also enter a custom percentage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <span class="csg-dbox-option">Scale</span> field allows you to enter a custom percentage:
                    values under 100% will reduce the size of the printed output and
                    values over 100% will increase the size of the printed output.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Apply</span></span>.
        </li>
        <li class="csg-list-style-none">
            Until you change this setting, this is how the current document will be printed.

    </ol>

    <h2><a name="printing_labels" id="printing_labels"></a>Printing labels</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz includes special facilities to make it easy for you to print labels.
        To do this you will need your name and address list stored as a CSV, Fireworkz or other data file.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a new document based on a label template.</li>
        <li>RISC OS: Drop the CSV file icon on to this document.</li>
        <li>Windows: Choose <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert File</span> from the <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.</li>
        <li>
            You will see a dialogue box asking you whether you want to load the file as labels or as text.
            Select <span class="csg-dbox-option">Labels</span> and specify how many columns across the labels should be.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Insert</span></span>.<br />
            Fireworkz will create sheets of labels for you in this document.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may wish to fine-tune the label sheets before printing them.
            The top, left and bottom paper margins may need resetting to match your label sheets.
            You may want to reduce the type size if some of the addresses are too long to fit on a label.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should expect to have to experiment with the paper definition and the other settings
            by printing out a page or two till you succeed in printing out a page of perfect labels.
        </li>
        <li>
            The label style has the grid switched on to help you with your fine-tuning.
            When you are happy with the format you should switch this off.
        </li>
        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="../common/images/toolbar/print.png" alt="Print tool button" />
            Click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Print</span> tool button on the toolbar.
            Once you have got your page and labels set up correctly,
            you may wish to save the document as a template for future use.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="printing_problems" id="printing_problems"></a>Solving printing problems</h2>

    <p>
        While printing is usually as simple as clicking on the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Print</span> toolbar button, there are times when problems occur.
        Most of these are due to a failure of communication between your printer and the OS printer drivers, or to incorrect information being used by one of them.
    </p>
    <h4>Nothing happens when I try to print</h4>
    <p>Check the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The printer is connected to its power supply, switched on and switched on-line.</li>
        <li>The connection between the printer and your computer has not been broken, and the connectors at both ends of the cable are firmly seated in their sockets.</li>
        <li>If you are using a networked printer, check that you are properly logged on to the network.</li>
        <li>The printer is ready to use, i.e. is loaded with paper and has a ribbon or cartridge correctly inserted.</li>
        <li>The printer driver is directing its output to the correct port on your computer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before concluding that the problem lies with Fireworkz, see if it is possible to print from another program.</p>
    <h4>Edges of the page are missing, although the rest prints normally</h4>
    <p>
        This problem is usually caused by trying to print on a larger area
        of the paper than the printer is physically capable of printing on.
        Many types of printers are not able to print edge-to-edge on a sheet of paper,
        so if your page design has not taken this into account your document can often not be printed as intended.
    </p>
    <p>The problem is usually caused by a slight mismatch between your printer driver and printer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Check that the paper size selected in the printer driver
            is the same as the paper you are actually using,
            and the same size as your Fireworkz document is expecting.
            For the best results, the sizes used by all three should be the same.
            <br />
            Check the page size in the Fireworkz <span class="csg-dbox">Paper</span> dialogue box
            (from the <span class="csg-dbox">Page</span> menu).
            Check the printer driver page size definition using !Printers (RISC OS).
            If necessary reformat your document using the new information,
            using the <span class="csg-dbox-button">Read printer</span> button in the <span class="csg-dbox">Paper</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are using RISC OS, make sure that you have installed the correct
            printer driver from those supplied on the RISC OS applications disc.
            Refer to the <em>RISC OS User Guide</em> for further details.
            Also see the details of page setup in the chapter Page Design.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With PostScript laser printers, the standard PostScript printer driver leaves a small margin around the edge of pages.
        If you are still losing information from the edge of your pages,
        you will have to ensure that you leave sufficient margins for your printer to cope.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check that you have selected the correct paper size from the PostScript printer driver.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you are using a direct drive laser printer, such as ArcLaser or LaserDirect,
        make sure that you are using the printer drivers
        supplied with it and not the standard Acorn one.
    </p>
    <h4>The printer produces blank pages between each page of my document</h4>
    <p>
        One or more blank pages inserted between each page of the document usually indicates
        that Fireworkz or the printer driver are using a page length which is too long.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Check the page length of your printer by referring to its documentation.
            You may find that the problem is due to you using the correct page length
            for a smaller piece of paper than you are actually trying to print on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check that Fireworkz is using the correct information.
            Once you are sure that your printer driver is set up correctly,
            you can ensure that Fireworkz gets the right page size by using the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Read printer</span> button
            in the <span class="csg-dbox-option">Paper</span> dialogue box.
        </li>
    </ul>
