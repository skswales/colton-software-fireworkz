    <p>Date and time formats are managed via the Number section of the Style editor as well. They can be entered separately, or as part of the same combined date and time format:</p>

    <p>Your base style contains a date and time format which will be applied to dates and times which Fireworkz recognises.</p>

    <p>Fireworkz can interpret some sequences of numbers and separator characters as times and dates automatically.</p>

    <p>If you enter numbers in the format</p>

    <p>nn.nn.nn</p>

    <p>Fireworkz assumes that it is a date. If you enter numbers in the format</p>

    <p>nn:nn:nn</p>

    <p>Fireworkz assumes that it is a time.</p>

    <p>For other numbers, you will need to apply a style to them to format them as times or numbers. Define a style which displays times and numbers in the format you want. As with number formats, several predefined formats are available, or you can use one of the building blocks to design your own custom time and date formats.</p>
