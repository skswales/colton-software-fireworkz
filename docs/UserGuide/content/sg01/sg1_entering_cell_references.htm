    <h1><a name="entering_cell_references" id="entering_cell_references"></a>Entering cell references</h1>

    <p>The ability to cross-reference data, and to use the result of one calculation as the basis for another, is fundamental to spreadsheets. By using cell references your data can stay live throughout a chain of calculations, so that if you change the original data for the first calculation, all further calculations referring to it are automatically updated without any further effort from you.</p>

    <p>You can type a cell reference into a number cell. When evaluating the formula, Fireworkz uses the value of the referenced cell, which may itself be the result of a formula. If you were working with a large worksheet and wanted to create a summary section, this is one way to do it. If the value of the referenced cell changes, the value in the cell containing the reference is updated too.</p>

    <p>You should always make a reference to a cell rather than typing its value into a second cell as a constant. If the value changes (perhaps because you discovered an error earlier in your worksheet) the reference will be updated, and the new figure automatically passed on to further calculations which need it.</p>

    <p>To enter a cell reference:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that the caret is in the formula line, not on the worksheet. You cannot enter cell references into text cells.</li>

        <li>Point at the body of the worksheet. You will see that the cursor turns into a crosshair pointer.</li>

        <li>When you are pointing at the cell you want to reference, click on it.</li>

        <li>The cell reference will be entered on the formula line. It will appear in a different format to numbers which you type in directly: it will have a light grey background. As long as the reference has a light grey background, it is selected and can be deleted in one operation, because Fireworkz treats it as a single character.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Editing cell references</h2>

    <p>When you type another character, enter a function or operator, or enter another cell reference, the grey highlight disappears. The cell reference is no longer subject to special treatment.</p>

    <p>You can now edit the elements of the cell reference individually, for example, replacing the row or column part of it.</p>
