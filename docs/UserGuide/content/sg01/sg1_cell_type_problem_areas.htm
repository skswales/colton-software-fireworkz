    <p>There are a few occasions when Fireworkz may not make a sensible decision about the contents of a cell.</p>

    <p>The most notable of these is numeric or alphanumeric information which you wish to store as text rather than numbers. Telephone numbers and British postcodes which you wish to enter in a database are good examples.</p>

    <p>Fireworkz may attempt to recognise these as cell references, because of their letter/number format. If you are entering address details in cells, the easiest ways to avoid this problem are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Enclose telephone numbers or postcodes in double quotes if you are typing them on the formula line. This will ensure that they are entered as strings, i.e. text not as numbers or cell references.</li>

        <li>Click in the cell to type them in the cell, not on the formula line. By typing directly into the worksheet you are entering the text as text, not as data.</li>
    </ul>
