    <p>Text and Number cells behave differently in several important ways.</p>

    <h2>Behaviour of text cells</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You can type text directly on to the worksheet. You can do this either when the cell already has some text in it, or when the new cell type in its style is set to text.</li>

        <li>Anything entered in a text cell is stored as a text paragraph. Whether you type in a number, text, a date or a time, it is stored as text and you cannot perform calculations on it directly.</li>

        <li>A cell reference to a text cell will always treat the contents of the cell as a string.</li>

        <li>You can enter automatic page numbers and live dates into text cells, as well as filenames and pathnames, using the <b>Inserts</b> menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Uses of text cells</h2>

    <p>Use text cells for headings, non-numeric information such as peoples names, labels, and annotation of your worksheet.</p>
