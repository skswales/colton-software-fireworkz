    <h1><a name="moving_from_cell_to_cell" id="moving_from_cell_to_cell"></a>Moving from cell to cell</h1>

    <p>Whether you are entering text or data, it will appear in the current cell. This is the cell which has a border or other highlight around it. Whatever you type in the formula line will be placed in the cell.</p>

    <p>Combine the process of moving to another cell with confirming the contents of the current one using <a href="sg1_autoentry.htm">Autoentry</a></p>

    <p>You can move around the worksheet from cell to cell in several ways. The simplest options are to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Click on the cell you want with the left mouse button. You will see that its border is highlighted, and that the row and column borders show that one of their cells is selected.</li>

        <li>Use the arrow/cursor keys to move around the worksheet. There are several keyboard shortcuts to make it easier to get to the cell you want..</li>

        <li>You can tell which is the current cell, because its column and row headings are highlighted, and a border appears around the cell on the worksheet. The precise appearance of the current cell is governed by the Current cell style in the style list. If you want to change this, see the chapter on Styles in the main Fireworkz guide for details on changing styles.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the current cell is a text cell, the caret will appear in the cell. If it is a number cell the caret will appear in the formula line at the top of the window when you start typing.</p>
