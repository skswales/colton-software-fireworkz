    <h1><a name="entering_numbers" id="entering_numbers"></a>Entering numbers</h1>

    <p>Much of your work with Fireworkz will consist of entering numbers which you will then manipulate and analyse with formulae.</p>

    <p>Numbers which appear in the spreadsheet because you have typed them in are called <b>constants</b>. Other numbers which might appear on your page are the displayed results of formulae.</p>

    <h2>Number formats</h2>

    <p>Fireworkz always stores numbers in a plain format. Other information about the number, such as currency symbols, percentage symbols and so on, is applied to the number as a <a href="../sg03/sg3_number_formats_and_styles.htm">style</a>.</p>

    <p>When you enter a number, you must not enter any characters other than the numerals and if relevant the decimal point. Formatting information is applied to the number when it is displayed on the page as part of its style.</p>
