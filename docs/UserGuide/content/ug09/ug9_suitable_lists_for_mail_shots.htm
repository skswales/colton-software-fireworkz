    <h1><a name="suitable_lists_for_mail_shots" id="suitable_lists_for_mail_shots"></a>Suitable lists for mail shots</h1>

    <p>You can use quite a wide range of document types as the basis for the address list in your mail shots. You have two options:</p>

    <p>Using a list held in a Fireworkz worksheet</p>

    <p>Using a list stored in CSV format or saved as a CSV file from another program.</p>

    <p>Fireworkz requires the names and addresses to be held in rows, with each column acting as a distinct field. For accurate mail merge, a particular column in a document must always have the same type of information, such as surname or postcode. If the type of contents of a column differ in each row, you may find it difficult to set up mail merge precisely.</p>

    <p>It does not matter if there are blank cells in some rows. You can instruct Fireworkz to shuffle these out when the address is placed in the target document.</p>
