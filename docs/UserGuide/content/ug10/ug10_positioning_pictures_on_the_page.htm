    <h1><a name="positioning_pictures_on_the_page" id="positioning_pictures_on_the_page"></a>Positioning pictures on the page</h1>

    <p>Once you have added your picture to the document you may want to move it to a new place, fix it in the place it is in, or make it bigger or smaller. These actions can all be done on screen with the mouse so you can always see what is happening.</p>

    <h2>Repositioning pictures on the page</h2>

    <p>To move a picture around the page:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click the left mouse button within the picture so that its selection box is displayed.</li>

        <li>Move the pointer to inside the pictures selection box. The pointer will change into a hand.</li>

        <li>Click and hold the left mouse button down and drag to where you want to move the picture.</li>

        <li>When you release the left mouse button the picture will appear in its new location.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Fixing the position of pictures on the page</h2>

    <p>Pictures are always pinned to the cell/text layer of the document, so that they move if rows and columns are inserted or deleted. You can tell that the picture is pinned because the top left selection handle appears solid red, and the others are in outline.</p>

    <p>You may want to pin the bottom of the picture as well, for example if you are adding a border to an area of document and think you may want to insert some more rows in the middle of the section.</p>

    <p>To pin pictures:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click in the picture so that its selection box appears.</li>

        <li>Double-click in the bottom right selection handle.</li>

        <li>The selection handle will appear solid to show that the picture has been pinned to the cell.</li>

        <li>If the cell to which the bottom of the picture has been pinned moves, the picture will resize to take account of it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Unpinning pictures</h2>

    <p>
        You may want to unpin pictures so that they stay in the same
        position on the page, rather than floating with the paragraph or
        cell to which they have been pinned.
    </p>

    <p>
        To unpin pictures, double-click the top left selection handle so
        that it is an outline rather than a solid square. If the bottom right
        selection handle is solid (and therefore pinned) you should
        double-click that as well.
