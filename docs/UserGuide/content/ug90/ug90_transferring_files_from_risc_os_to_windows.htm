    <p>
        The process of transferring files to Windows is quite simple.
        The work needs to be done at the RISC OS end,
        so if you are going to be sent files and do not have access to an RISC OS computer,
        make sure that the person sending the files has a copy of this chapter and follows the instructions.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Check the document for any of the pitfalls outlined above.</li>

        <li>Save the file in a location which your Windows computer can access (for example on a DOS format floppy disc, or on a network server accessible to both types of machine).</li>

        <li>You will need to rename the file and change its type. Select the file in the Filer window and press the menu button. Choose Rename file from the menu which appears.</li>

        <li>Add the extension /FWK, for example FILENAME/FWK. This will be interpreted by Windows as FILENAME.FWK.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can now take the file to a Windows computer.</p>
