    <h1><a name="transferring_files_between_platforms_fonts" id="transferring_files_between_platforms_fonts"></a>Fonts (transfer)</h1>

    <p>
        Fireworkz stores the fonts used in documents internally by their PostScript name,
        if there is one, rather than any platform- or vendor-specific name.
        If most of the fonts you use on both platforms are standard fonts with standard PostScript names,
        you should find that the correct fonts are used.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, documents which use the RISC&nbsp;OS fonts Trinity and Homerton
        will be displayed in Times and Helvetica if those fonts are installed,
        or Times New Roman and Arial if only the minimum Windows fonts are installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your documents use non-standard fonts which do not have a direct equivalent on your other systems,
        another font will be used. Inevitably, this will mean that your text is reformatted.
    </p>

    <h2>Height and width</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz allows you to stretch and shrink type using the Width option in the Text section of the Style editor.
        Unfortunately, if this option has been set in RISC&nbsp;OS, it will mean that Windows may not display the text at the correct height or width.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ideally, you should turn this option off in all text before transferring files.
        If you do not, you may find that text is displayed at the height which matches the width which has been entered.
