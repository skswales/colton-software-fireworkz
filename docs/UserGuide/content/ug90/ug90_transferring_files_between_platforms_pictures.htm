    <h1><a name="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures" id="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures"></a>Pictures and charts (transferring)</h1>

    <p>
        Charts and pictures which are embedded within documents will be
        transferred along with the text and the rest of the document.
        Fireworkz will interpret and display most embedded picture files,
        and also more complex pictures such as pictogram charts which are effectively
        a Draw file containing embedded sprites or further Draw files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Referenced pictures will usually be transferred or translated.
        However, you must first make sure that the file names of referenced pictures can be understood by both systems.
        You will also need to make sure that in both the original and the copy that all the files are in the same directory:
        this makes it much easier for Fireworkz to find the files.
