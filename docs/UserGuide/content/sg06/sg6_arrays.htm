    <h1><a name="arrays" id="arrays"></a>Arrays</h1>

    <p>
        A set of values or cell references entered in a single cell or as a spreadsheet function parameter,
        which may be used to represent any arbitrary set of data, a matrix, or a complex number.
    </p>

    <p>Array constants should be entered in the form</p>
    <pre class="csg-sample-indent">{1,2,3;4,5,6}</pre>
    <p>with commas separating each element in a row of the array and semi-colons separating each row.</p>

    <p>
        Many spreadsheet functions return array results, which can be passed to further functions.
        Cells containing an array-returning function just display the first (or top-left) element of that result.
        Individual elements (or sub-arrays) may be obtained from such results using the <a href="../sg06i/sg6_INDEX.htm">INDEX</a> function.
