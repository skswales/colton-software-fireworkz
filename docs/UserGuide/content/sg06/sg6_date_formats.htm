    <p>Dates should be entered in the form</p>
    <p class="csg-sample-indent csg-user-text">day.month.year</p>
    <p>where the components are expressed in figures with or without leading zeros.</p>
    <p>There must be two full stops and no spaces within the date.</p>
    <p>If you only give two digits of the year, Fireworkz will use a sliding window to determine the century used.</p>
