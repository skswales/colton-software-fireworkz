    <h1><a name="ranges" id="ranges"></a>Ranges</h1>

    <p>A range is a contiguous group of cells described by its top-left and bottom-right cell references (both inclusive).</p>

    <p>Ranges should be entered in the form</p>
    <pre class="csg-sample-indent"><em>cell_reference_tl</em>:<em>cell_reference_br</em></pre>

    <p class="csg-function-subheading">Example:</p>
    <pre class="csg-sample-indent">A1:B3</pre>
    <p>This example describes a group of cells two columns wide and three rows deep, with cell A1 as its top left and cell B3 as its bottom right.</p>

    <p>
        Note: Like its predecessor PipeDream, Fireworkz will accept ranges entered in the form <code>A1B3</code>,
        i.e. you need not use a colon to separate the two cell references which make up a range.
        The above example is given for users of other spreadsheet applications who are used to entering ranges using colon as a separator.
        All examples given in this documentation also use the colon separator in ranges for clarity.
    </p>

    <p>A single cell may be specified as a range, e.g. <code>B2:B2</code> .</p>
