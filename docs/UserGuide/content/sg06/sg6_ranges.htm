    <h1><a name="ranges" id="ranges"></a>Ranges</h1>

    <p>A range is a group of cells described by its top-left and bottom-right cell references.</p>

    <p>Ranges should be entered in the form</p>

    <p>A1:B3</p>

    <p>The above example describes a group of cells two columns wide and three rows deep, with cell A1 as its top left and cell B3 as its bottom right.</p>

    <p>
        Note that Fireworkz will accept ranges entered in the form A1B3,
        i.e. you need not use any characters to separate the two cell references which make up a range.
        The above example is given for users of other spreadsheets who are used to entering ranges using colon as a separator.
        All examples in this documentation also use the colon separator for clarity.
