    <p>You may wish to remove column boundaries in some rows of your table, perhaps because a row is being used as a heading or break in the table. The method described here is one way to do this: you could also <a href="ug8_straddling_cells.htm">straddle</a> the two cells.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the left of the two cells you want to merge.</li>

        <li>Point at the column width marker at its righthand side.</li>

        <li>Press the <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button and drag the column width marker to the edge of the righthand of the two cells.</li>

        <li>When you release the left mouse button you will see that the cell boundary has disappeared. You can repeat this process across as many columns as you need, but if you want to widen a cell over several columns you have to do it from right to left, column by column. This is because you can only drag one column border at a time in this way.</li>
    </ol>
