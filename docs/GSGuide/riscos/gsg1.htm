<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>About Fireworkz and Fireworkz Pro</h2>

<p>Fireworkz and Fireworkz Pro are part of the Z family of applications from
Colton Software. This family includes the stand-alone applications Wordz,
Resultz and Recordz. These stand-alone applications were developed for systems
with very little memory in the early 1990s and are no longer available
separately.</p>

<h3>Wordz</h3>

<p>Wordz could be used alone as a word processor to write letters, reports,
books, invitations, shopping lists, schedules and other documents.</p>

<h3>Resultz</h3>

<p>Resultz could be used alone as a spreadsheet to perform calculations,
analyse figures, and produce colourful charts.</p>

<h3>Recordz</h3>

<p>Recordz could be used alone as a database to store and manage all kinds of
data from school and business information to personal details about projects
and collections.</p>

<h3>Fireworkz</h3>

<p>Fireworkz combines the features of Wordz and Resultz enabling you to do even
more—incorporate live results in your reports, or automatic mail-merge to your
friends or customers, for example.</p>

<h3>Fireworkz Pro</h3>

<p>Fireworkz Pro further combines the features of Recordz enabling you to
create fully integrated documents.</p>

<p>Once you have learned to use one of these programs you will find it easy to
use the other members of the family, because they share much of the same
interface and have been designed to work well together. This is true even if
you move from RISC OS to Windows or vice versa; the programs have been
designed to be as similar as possible on each platform.</p>

<h2>About this Getting Started Guide</h2>

<p>This Getting Started Guide includes all the information you need to
start using Fireworkz on RISC&nbsp;OS.</p>

<ul>
<li>A brief installation guide</li>

<li>Tutorials using supplied documents to show you the main features of the
program</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about the program and its features in the
User Guide and Spreadsheet Guide
and in the on-line help.</p>

<p>A tutorial for the database can be found in the Database Guide (Fireworkz Pro).</p>

<h3>Knowledge assumed</h3>

<p>This Getting Started Guide assumes that you are already reasonably familiar
with the way your computer works. If you are new to computing, you are advised
to familiarise yourself both with the relevant terminology and the basics of
using your computer. You will need to know how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start up programs and open documents;</li>

<li>View directories and copy files;</li>

<li>Display menus and choose entries from them;</li>

<li>Position and resize windows, minimise and restore windows;</li>

<li>Scroll through documents using the scroll bars and arrows;</li>

<li>Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen and to
position the caret;</li>

<li>Use the mouse buttons to click, double-click and drag objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should understand terms such as directory, double-click and
dialogue box.</p>

<p>You should be able to find all this information in the system documentation
which came with your computer. The tutorial chapters in this Getting Started
Guide also provide a reminder of these skills.</p>

<h3>Text in this Getting Started Guide</h3>

<p>When working your way through the tutorial chapters, you will see that
certain stylistic conventions are used to make it easier for you to see what
you should do at each stage, what you should type in and what you should
choose from menus.</p>

<p>Certain button, options and commands always appear in the text in bold type. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Menu options. For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Choose the
<span class="csguide-menu-option">Print</span> command from the
<span class="csguide-menu">File</span> menu.’</li>

<li>Action and option buttons in dialogue boxes. For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.’</li>

<li>Buttons on the toolbar. For example:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">Style</span> button.’</li>
</ul>

<p>In some places there is text for you to type in. This is always shown in a
typewriter-style font, like this:</p>

<blockquote><kbd>Type this text on your computer exactly as you see it.</kbd></blockquote>

<p>When the text given represents what you will type, for example, the name
to be given to a file before saving it, this is shown by using italics, such
as:</p>

<blockquote>Type <var>filename</var> in the dialogue box which appears.</blockquote>

<p>There are several keyboard shortcuts which you can use in Fireworkz.</p>

<p>If you see a key combination such as
<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl-X</span>, it means you should
press the keys together in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Press and hold down the first key of the pair.</li>

<li>Press and release the second key.</li>

<li>Release the first key.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the Control key is also represented by ^ and is shown as such
on menu short cuts. So, for example, if you see ^X you should press and hold
down the Control key, press and release X and then release the Control
key. Similarly, the Shift key is also represented by a broad up-arrow.</p>

<p>Some commands can be accessed directly by pressing a <em>function
key</em>. Where this is the case the function key is referred to by the name
shown on the key cap itself; for example function key F1.</p>

<p>You will see many references to the <em>caret</em>. This is the
special pointer which shows you where you are in a document, and where any new
text you add will be placed.</p>

<h3>Conventions used</h3>

<p>There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your computer,
the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry out.</p>

<h4>The mouse</h4>

<p>The three buttons on your mouse each perform separate functions, and
their names, Select, Menu and Adjust reflect this.</p>

<p>Many actions using the mouse are performed by clicking or double-clicking
an object. To do this, position the pointer over the required object and
press and release the (left) Select button once or twice respectively.</p>

<p>Pressing the (middle) Menu button with the pointer inside a Fireworkz
window displays the main application menu, from which you may choose an
option by pointing at it and clicking with the Select button.</p>

<p>The (right) Adjust button can be used to access some short cuts and more
sophisticated functions.</p>

<h4>The window</h4>

<p>The following terms are used for the icons and buttons with which you
control windows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Window title bar.

<div class="csguide-li-para">This includes some helpful infomation about your Fireworkz document:</div>

<ul>
<li>If you have saved the document, its file name is given.</li>

<li>If the document is new, the name of the template
on which it is based is given. (More information about use of templates is given in the User Guide).</li>

<li>If the document has been modified since it was
last save, an asterisk will be added</li>

<li>If you have a number of open windows belonging to
the same document, the title of the document will contain a numeral indicating the number of views.</li>

<li>If the document is being viewed at a scale other
than 100%, the scale being used in that view will be added.</li>
</ul>

<li>Minimise button.

<div class="csguide-li-para">Used to remove the window from the display to the Windows taskbar.</div></li>

<li>Maximise button.

<div class="csguide-li-para">Used to make the window as large as possible on the display.</div></li>

<li>Close button.

<div class="csguide-li-para">Used to close the window.</div>

<div class="csguide-li-para">When closing the last view of a modified
Fireworkz document, you will be asked whether or not you wish to save
the document before closing it, or simply discard your changes and
close the window.</div></li>

<li>Scroll bar</li>
</ul>
