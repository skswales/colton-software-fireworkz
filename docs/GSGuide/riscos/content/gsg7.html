    <h1><div class="csg-section-number">7</div>Advanced features</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This chapter introduces several of the more sophisticated features of Fireworkz.</p>

    <p>Topics covered include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Using pictures</li>

        <li>Adding a date</li>

        <li>Setting up and perform mail merge</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pictures</h2>

    <p>
        Load the document <var>saleslet2</var> from the <var>Tutorial</var> directory.
        You will see that it contains a letter from a company which is a standard
        reply to customers who have enquired about prices and products.
    </p>

    <p>
        The document contains a picture, the name of the company in coloured
        letters up the side of the page, the company’s address, the text of the
        letter and, at the bottom of the page, a table.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding pictures</h3>

    <p>
        Pictures, either in the form of Draw files, Sprites or JPEGs can be
        added to a document simply by drawgging the file containing them in to
        your open document. In this example, the company logo has been added using
        this technique.
    </p>

    <h3>Moving a picture</h3>

    <p>
        The picture is in the wrong place. It is in the centre of the page when it
        should be aligned with the left-hand edge of the text. To move it:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click in the area of the picture. A red outline will appear, with handles at the corners and on the edges.</li>

        <li>
            Point inside this outline, press and hold down the left mouse button and
            drag the picture to the left, until its left-hand edge aligns with the text.
        </li>

        <li>Release the mouse button. The picture will be dropped at this new position.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Changing the size of a picture</h3>

    <p>Now, you need to reduce the size of the picture:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click in the area of the picture. A red outline will appear, with handles at the corners and on the edges.</li>

        <li>
            Point at the bottom right-hand corner handle, press and hold down the
            left mouse button and drag this corner around until the picture is
            approximately half of its original size.
        </li>

        <li>Release the mouse button. The picture will be resized to this new size.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Dates</h2>

    <p>
        The next step is to add the date to the letter.
        You can add dates in a wide range of formats.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click at the left-hand edge of the line above the line containing the text ‘add1’.</li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_justify_right.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Right justify</span> button on the toolbar.
            The caret will move to the right-hand edge of the page.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Date</span> from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Insert field</span> submenu of the
            <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Insert date</span> dialogue box will appear.

            <br /><span>Fireworkz always uses today’s date as an example and shows it in each available format in the dialogue box.</span>
        </li>

        <li>Choose one of the formats from the list.</li>

        <li>
            Ensure that the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Live</span> option is set, by clicking on it
            if necessary. This means that whenever you open this document, the current date
            will be used. If this option is switched off, the date entered today will stay
            fixed in the document.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. The date will be inserted into the document and displayed using the format you selected.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Mail merge</h2>

    <p>
        When this letter is sent to customers, it is personalised to some extent.
        As enquiries arrive they are logged in a database, held in a separate Fireworkz
        document. At the end of the day, responses to all the enquiries are printed
        using the mail shot facility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Load the document <var>names</var> from the <var>Tutorial</var> directory.
        You will see that it contains a database of names and addresses held in the
        rows of a spreadsheet.
    </p>

    <h3>Selecting the database</h3>

    <p>
        The first stage in setting up a mail merge is to choose the database holding
        the names and addresses to be used. In this example, it is held in the
        <var>Names</var> spreadsheet. You could have used:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A list stored in a Fireworkz or Resultz spreadsheet</li>

        <li>A list stored in CSV format.</li>

        <li>A database stored in a Fireworkz Pro or Recordz document (Pro only).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To tell Fireworkz which document to use for mail merge:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that <var>saleslet2</var> is the active document by clicking in it if necessary.</li>

        <li>
            Open the
            <span class="csg-menu">Mail merge</span> submenu from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Extra - Text</span> menu, and choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Select source...</span>.
            A dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            You need to select the file to use as your source of data. Click on
            <span class="csg-list-option">names</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Next you need to select the row which will be used to show you what is
            happening when you add fields to your letter. Choose row 1 as this is the one
            containing the titles of the columns.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Adding fields to the letter</h3>

    <p>You are now ready to add the fields to your document. To do this:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the first line of the recipient’s address, ‘add1’, in the
            <var>saleslet2</var> document.
        </li>

        <li>
            Open the
            <span class="csg-menu">Mail merge</span> submenu from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Extra - Text</span> menu, and choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Insert field</span>.
            A dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            You need to enter the number of the column holding the information you
            want to appear here. The first address field in the Names document is column
            4, so enter 4 in the dialogue box.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. In the sales letter
            document, you will see that the text ‘add1’ has been replaced by ‘Address1’.
        </li>

        <li>
            Go through the next three lines, adding fields 5, 6 and 7.
            These should insert text reading Address2, Address3 and Postcode
            respectively.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In the salutation line of the letter, you need to add the fields for the
        title and the name:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the word ‘title’ and insert field 1.</li>

        <li>Select the word ‘name’ and insert field 3.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Dealing with blank fields</h3>

    <p>
        One problem with this mail merge is that some addresses in the list have blank
        fields, often before the postcode, which could cause blank lines to appear
        within the address in the finished letter.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Open the
            <span class="csg-menu">Mail merge</span> submenu from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Extra - Text</span> menu, and choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Select source...</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose row 5 and click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
            This will display the information for the fifth line of the database.
            You will see that this introduces a blank line into the document as it contains an empty entry for the Address3 field.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Fireworkz allows you to deal with this as follows:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Select source...</span> again,
            and click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Shuffle</span> button.
            This tells Fireworkz to move any blank lines that appear in the document
            between certain fields to the end of the space.
        </li>

        <li>
            The fields which you want to shuffle are just those containing address
            information, so enter 4 as the start row and 7 as the end row in the
            dialogue box.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. This will shuffle the
            blank line to the end thereby compacting the displayed address.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Printing</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can print a test page using the currently selected record by
            clicking the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>

        <li>
            If the test page appears correct, you can print a copy of the letter
            for each of the people in the database.
            Choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> again but this time click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Mailshot</span> button.
        </li>
    </ol>
