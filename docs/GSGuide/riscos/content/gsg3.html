    <h1><div class="csg-section-number">3</div>First steps in Fireworkz</h1>

    <p>
        This chapter will show you how to perform the most essential word
        processing tasks with Fireworkz. You will learn how to enter and correct text
        using the keyboard and how to use Fireworkz' toolbar buttons, ruler and menus to
        format and manage your text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even if you are an experienced word processor and computer user, you should
        work through the exercises which follow to see the best way to perform these
        tasks in Fireworkz.
    </p>

    <p>Topics covered include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Loading a document;</li>

        <li>Getting ready to type by placing the caret within the document;</li>

        <li>Entering and correcting text;</li>

        <li>Moving text around the document using the Cut, Copy and Paste buttons;</li>

        <li>Using the Fireworkz ruler to change margins and indent a paragraph;</li>

        <li>Using the justification buttons to position your text;</li>

        <li>Using the Style button to create a heading;</li>

        <li>Printing your document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When you have completed this part of the
        tutorial you will be fully equipped to create and produce simple documents
        using Fireworkz, and ready to proceed to the next chapter.
    </p>

    <h2>Loading a document</h2>

    <p>You will be working on one of the documents supplied in the Tutorial directory.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Find the <var>Tutorial</var> directory using the Filer.
            This directory should be in the <var>Examples</var> directory
            that you should already have downloaded and extracted.
        </li>

        <li>
            Find the file named <var>Theatre</var> and double-click it to start
            Fireworkz and open that document.
        </li>

        <li>The following window will appear on your desktop:</li>
        <img src="images/theatre_13.png" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" />
    </ol>

    <h3>Parts of a Fireworkz document window</h3>

    <p>The central main area with a white background represents the printable area onto which you can enter your document. Anything inside this printable area will appear when your document is printed.</p>

    <p>The surrounding area with a light grey background represents the paper margins. Anything within the paper margins will not appear when your document is printed.</p>

    <p>The thin dark grey areas represent the gaps between pages in your document.</p>

    <h4>Menus</h4>

    <p>
        Just below each Fireworkz document's window title bar,
        you will find the Fireworkz Menu bar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking on a word in the Fireworkz menu, for example, <em>File</em>,
        will bring up the corresponding menu
        <span class="csg-menu">File</span>.
    </p>

    <p>Options may be chosen from a menu by pointing at them and then clicking on them.</p>

    <p>
        Several options will execute commands that bring up dialogue boxes for
        user input; these are indicated with an ellipsis (&hellip;) alongside the option name, for example, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Save as&hellip;</span> option on the
        <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several menus contain submenus; these are indicated by the right-pointing
        arrow alongside the option name. These submenus may be accessed by sliding the
        mouse pointer off the right-hand side of the menu past the right-pointing arrow;
        this will cause the submenu to be displayed.
    </p>

    <p>Frequently used menu options have keyboard shortcuts which are shown alongside the option name in each menu.</p>

    <p><strong>Greyed out (disabled) menu options</strong></p>

    <p>
        From time to time, certain menu options may be greyed out (disabled)
        to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort&hellip;</span> option
        to sort an area of your document unless you have an area selected.
        If you do not have an area selected, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort&hellip;</span> option
        will be greyed out. As soon as you select an area, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort&hellip;</span> option
        will no longer be greyed out.
    </p>

    <h4>Toolbar</h4>

    <p>
        At the top of each Fireworkz document's window
        below the Menu bar, you will find the Fireworkz toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        This contains a set of tool buttons that allow you to access the most
        commonly used tools quickly and easily using a single click.
    </p>

    <p>
        The toolbar may change depending on the type of work you are doing.
        For example, when using Fireworkz Pro, if you are working within an area of
        a document which contains a database, you will see the toolbar containing
        database buttons. When working in another area of the document, you will see
        the normal word processing and spreadsheet toolbar buttons.
    </p>

    <p>If you point the mouse pointer over toolbar buttons, a ToolTip message appears explaining the function of the button.</p>

    <p><strong>Greyed out (disabled) buttons</strong></p>

    <p>
        From time to time, certain buttons may be greyed out (disabled)
        to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> button
        to remove an area of your document unless you have an area selected.
        If you do not have an area selected, the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> button
        will be greyed out. As soon as you select an area, the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> button
        will no longer be greyed out.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pressed in buttons</strong></p>

    <p>
        Certain buttons may appear to be 'pressed in' or 'pushed out'
        to indicate whether or not particular options are currently selected.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> button
        is pressed in (selected), then any text which you type will appear in a bold font. If the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> button
        is pushed out (not selected), then any text which you type will appear in a normal font. If you click the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> button
        it will alternate between these two states.
    </p>

    <h4>The status line</h4>

    <p>
        The status line appears below the toolbar. It provides help and infomation
        about the work in progess. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If you point the mouse pointer over control areas of the window, such as
            the toolbar, a message appears explaining the function of the button.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you drag the left margin (or other) marker in the ruler, the precise
            measurements are shown in the selected unit of measurement, enabling you to
            align text and paragraphs precisely.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you perform certain operations, such as word counts, the results are
            displayed in the status line until the mouse pointer is moved again.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you click in a database cell within your document, the number
            of records in the database will be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Rulers</h4>

    <p>There are two rulers you can choose to display:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A horizontal ruler, along the top of the document.</li>

        <li>A vertical ruler, down the left-hand side of the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Horizontal ruler</h4>

    <p>The horizontal ruler can be used to alter the:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Paragraph margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of the first line of a paragraph.</li>

        <li>Left margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of subsequent lines in a paragraph.</li>

        <li>Right margin - this determines the position of the right-hand edge of lines in a paragraph.</li>

        <li>Tab positions - these determine where text will appear when it is preceded by one or more inserted tabs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Vertical ruler</h4>

    <p>The vertical ruler can be used to alter the:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Header margin - this determines the distance between the top of the printable area and the top of the work area.</li>

        <li>Header offset - this determines the distance between the top of the printable area and any header text.</li>

        <li>Footer margin - this determines the distance between the bottom of the work area and the bottom of the printable area.</li>

        <li>Footer offset - this determines the distance between the bottom of the work area and any footer text.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changing your view of the document</h2>

    <h3>Changing the window size</h3>

    <p>
        When the window appears initially, it will occupy only part of the screen. To make the window as large as possible point to the Maximise button near
        the top right-hand corner of the window and click on it. The window will
        enlarge to cover all or most of the screen area.
    </p>

    <p>You may. at some other stage, wish to make your window smaller; for example to view other windows at the same time. To do this, point to the Restore Down button near the top right-hand corner of the window and click on it.</p>

    <h3>Changing the scale at which you view the document</h3>

    <p>
        Unless you have an extremely large monitor, you won't be able to see
        all of your document at once on screen. Only a portion of it will be visible
        in the window.
    </p>

    <p>
        For some types of work, such as editing text, you might prefer a close-up
        view of part of the document. For others, such as checking that the whole
        document conforms to the style you have chosen and looks good, you will want to
        check the whole document at once, and a reduced size which enables you see it
        all at once on screen is appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have a large monitor, you can keep two or more views open
        simultaneously, one at 100% and another at a smaller size such as 50%,
        although this slows down the redrawing of the screen.
    </p>

    <h4>Changing the scale</h4>

    <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_view_control.png" />
    <p>
        To change the way in which the document is presented on screen, click the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">View control</span> button at the
        top left of the toolbar.
    </p>

    <p>
        The
        <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box will appear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Look at the group of buttons entitled
        <span class="csg-dbox-button">Scale</span>.
        There are several choices available to you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            To see a scaled-down version of the document, click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">50%</span> button and then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>

        <li>
            Type in a percentage value, or use the arrows to increase or decrease the
            value shown in the box, then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>

        <li>
            To see the biggest version of the document that will fit on your screen,
            click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Fit</span> button and then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
            This will shrink or expand the view so that you see one complete page across
            the screen.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You will probably find it easiest to edit text with the largest scale that
        shows you a full line of text on the screen. Equally, you will sometimes want
        to scale down your view of a document so that you can see a whole page on
        screen at once, to check the overall formatting before printing.
    </p>

    <h3>Moving around the document</h3>

    <h4>Changing the visible portion of the document</h4>

    <p>
        While you are typing, Fireworkz will always keep the caret on screen, so if
        you are simply typing continuous text you will only need to do this if you want
        to go and look at a part of the document which has scrolled off the screen.
    </p>

    <h4>Moving the caret around</h4>

    <p>You can move the caret around the document in several ways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Use the mouse to move the pointer around, and when you are pointing to the
            place where you want the caret to be, click the left mouse button. The caret
            will jump to the new position.

            <br /><span>
                This is the best way to move around
                if you want to move the caret a long way.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li>
            Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the caret a line or a character
            at a time. The left and right arrow keys move the caret a character to the
            left and right respectively, and the up and down arrow keys move the caret a
            line up and down respectively.

            <br /><span>
                This is the best way to move around
                if you only need to move the caret a few characters or lines at a time.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li>
            Use the
            <span class="csg-key">Page Up</span> and
            <span class="csg-key">Page Down</span> keys to move through a document
            a screen-full at a time. The caret will automatically move up or down a
            screen-full when you press one of these keys.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Entering and editing text</h2>

    <p>
        The simplest and most important word processing task is typing the text
        into the document.
    </p>

    <h3>Entering text</h3>

    <h4>Adding text to a paragraph</h4>

    <p>
        To put new text in a particular part of a document, you first need to place
        the <strong>caret</strong> there.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Use the mouse to move the pointer to the start of the paragraph beginning
            ‘This year...’.
        </li>

        <li>
            When you are pointing at the exact place you want to insert text, click
            the left button.
        </li>

        <li>
            You are ready to start typing. Enter the following text:

            <blockquote class="csg-user-text">
                As you will realise, the annual school trip to the
                pantomime is almost upon us.
            </blockquote>

            Only enter the words, punctuation marks and spaces and do not press
            <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> at the end of lines; if a new line is
            needed within a paragraph Fireworkz will automatically begin one.
        </li>

        <li>
            Type a space after the full stop so that there is a single space between
            the full stop and the beginning of the next sentence.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Starting a new paragraph</h3>

    <p>To add a new paragraph you will need to start a new line.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret at the end of the paragraph by pointing there with the mouse and clicking the left button.</li>

        <li>
            Press
            <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> on the keyboard. The caret will move
            to the left margin ready for you to enter the following text:

            <blockquote class="csg-user-text">
                If you have not already paid for your child’s ticket,
                please send £3 as soon as possible.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Moving text around the document</h3>

    <p>Some of the text in the letter is in the wrong order. It needs to be moved to the correct position by <em>selecting</em>, <em>cutting</em> and <em>pasting</em> it.</p>

    <p>
        You use these buttons to perform these actions:<br />

        <img src="images/tbar_sccp.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding-top: 10px;" />
    </p>

    <h4>Selecting text to move</h4>

    <p>
        There are two ways to select areas of text. Try both and see which you
        prefer.
    </p>

    <p>The first way:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Point at the beginning of the text you want to select (in this case the
            paragraph beginning ‘If you have...’.
        </li>

        <li>
            Press and hold down the left mouse button while dragging the pointer to
            the left edge of the start of the next paragraph (but make sure that you do not
            actually select any of the text in the next paragraph). Dragging as far as the
            start of the next paragraph ensures that you select the whole paragraph.
        </li>

        <li>
            When you can see that the text you want to select is all highlighted,
            release the mouse button to confirm the selection.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The second way:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the caret at the beginning of the paragraph you just entered,
            ‘If you have...’.
        </li>

        <li>
            Point to the end of the paragraph, just after the full stop, and press the
            <span class="csg-key">Shift</span>
            key while clicking the left mouse button. The text between the two mouse clicks is now selected.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_selection_on.png" />
    <p>
        Note that when you have an area selected, the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Selection</span> button on the toolbar
        turns black. In addition, many of the buttons are no longer greyed out indicating that the operations that they perform are now available.
    </p>

    <h4>Cutting and pasting</h4>

    <p>To move the selected text, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_cut.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> button on the toolbar. Your selected text will disappear from the document, but it is stored
            internally by the computer. It will be remembered until you cut or copy
            another piece of text, or quit Fireworkz.
        </li>

        <li>Position the caret at the beginning of the line ‘Yours faithfully’.</li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_paste.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Paste</span> button on the toolbar. The text will appear in the new position.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Correcting mistakes</h3>

    <p>
        Cutting enables you to remove text from a document but to keep a copy of it
        internally for use elsewhere.
        You can also do this by making a selection and then typing over it.
    </p>

    <p>
        However you will often want to remove text and throw it away. You
        do this by using the
        <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scroll up to the top of the document. Look at the text in the first
        paragraph. You probably have already noticed that there are some mistakes and
        repeated words in it.
    </p>

    <h4>Deleting a single character</h4>

    <p>The word ‘Australians’ should not have the final ‘s’. To delete it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Position the caret just after the word Australians, either with the mouse or
            using the arrow keys.
        </li>

        <li>
            Press the
            <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key.
            The unwanted character ‘s’ will be removed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Deleting a word</h4>

    <p>
        In the first paragraph, the word ‘Cinderella’ is repeated by mistake.
        To correct this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Position the caret anywhere within one of the occurrences of the word
            ‘Cinderella’ by pointing there and double-clicking with the left mouse
            button. The whole word will be selected and appear reversed out (i.e. white on black).
        </li>

        <li>
            Press the
            <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key as before. The caret will now be in the space where the word was, with a space on either side of it.
        </li>

        <li>
            Press the
            <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key again to remove the surplus
            space.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Deleting a block of text</h4>

    <p>
        Further down the paragraph the words ‘and retired footballers who visited the school earlier this year for coaching sessions’ appear.
        To remove these:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret in front of the comma before the word ‘and’.</li>

        <li>Select the block of text ending just before the full stop. The selected text will appear reversed out (i.e. white on black).</li>

        <li>
            Press the
            <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key. The words will disappear.
        </li>

        <li>
            When you delete a block of text, you need to make sure that you do not
            leave any double spaces between words. If necessary, press the
            <span class="csg-key">Delete</span> key again to remove any spurious spaces.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Typing over a selection</h4>

    <p>If you simply want to replace text with different text:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the word(s) you want to replace. You can select anything from a
            single character to the complete contents of the document.
        </li>

        <li>Type in the new word(s). The old text will disappear and the new text will appear in its place.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note that simply typing over selected text will actually cut it.</p>

    <h3>Changing case</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes you need to change the case of one or more words, changing the
        letters from upper to lower case or vice versa, or adding initial capitals as
        in a proper name.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the sample document the heading needs to be changed to capital
        letters:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the heading paragraph ‘Visit to pantomime’.</li>

        <li>
            Open the
            <span class="csg-menu">Change case</span> submenu from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu and choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">UPPER-CASE</span> option.
        </li>

        <li>You will see that the selected text is now in upper case.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Formatting</h2>

    <p>
        The document which you have been working on has a very simple format.
        It is now time to improve its look, by changing the justification, style,
        fonts and effects used within it.
    </p>

    <h3>Justification</h3>

    <p>
        Different parts of the document need to be aligned differently on the
        paper. The alignment of text in relation to the margins is called
        justification. For example, the address is usually flush against the right
        margin, headings are often centred so that they are in the middle of the
        paper, and the main body of text is often printed so that it is flush against
        both margins.
    </p>

    <p>
        The letter you are working on requires use of each kind of justification.
        At the moment all the paragraphs are left justified. The left-hand edge of
        each line of text is next to the margin, but the right-hand side ends where
        the last word finishes, producing a ragged right-hand edge.
        Typesetters often refer to this as ‘ragged right’. This is the default
        setting, which will appear in your documents if you do not explicitly choose
        an alternative.
    </p>

    <h4>Choosing justification settings</h4>

    <p>
        Changing the justification of a paragraph of text is as simple as clicking
        in it and then clicking on one of the four buttons in the justification
        palette group on the toolbar, shown below:<br />

        <img src="images/tbar_lcrf.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding-top: 10px;" />
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Each button in the justification palette shows a rough guide to the way
            your text will appear if you select it.
        </li>

        <li>The currently selected button appears to have been pressed in.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The following examples show you how to use justification in the sample
        document.
    </p>

    <h4>Right justified - ragged left</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the five lines of text which form the address at the top of the letter.</li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_justify_right.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Right justify</span> button on the toolbar.
            This is the second button from the right in the justification palette.
            The text will move so that it is up against the righthand margin.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Centred</h4>

    <p>
        Centring is often used for headings and for documents with only a small
        amount of text, such as posters and invitations.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the paragraph which heads the letter - the line of text which reads
            ‘VISIT TO PANTOMIME’.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_justify_centre.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Centre justify</span> button on the toolbar.
            This is the the second button from the left in the justification palette.
            The text will move to the middle of the screen.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Changing the margin - using the ruler</h3>

    <p>
        You can use the ruler to change the margins of lines and paragraphs within
        the document.
    </p>

    <h4>Indenting paragraphs</h4>

    <p>
        In the middle of the document <var>Theatre</var> are a set of dates.
        These will stand out more if the paragraphs containing them are indented.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select the paragraphs beginning with ‘Year’ and ending with ‘Thursday’.</li>

        <li>
            Point at the left margin marker, which is a small upwards-pointing
            triangle in the ruler above the text. You will use this to indent the
            paragraph. Note how the status line confirms your actions.

            <img src="images/theatre_25.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding-top: 10px;" />
        </li>

        <li>
            While pointing at the marker, and while it is moving, you will see that
            the mouse pointer has changed to one with two horizontal arrows pointing to
            either side.
        </li>

        <li>
            Press and hold down the left mouse button and
            drag the marker one centimetre to the right and then release the mouse button. You can check the measurements by looking where the marker is on the ruler and
            also by reading the measurement on the status line.
        </li>

        <li>Release the mouse button and the paragraphs will be indented.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Note that the paragraph margin marker (the downwards-pointing arrow above
        the left margin marker) moves with the left margin marker.
        You can also move it separately.
    </p>

    <h3>Styles</h3>

    <p>
        One of the benefits of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
        word processing is that it enables you to
        experiment with styles and change the look of your document without having to
        print it out to see the results. Changing the style of text is easily accomplished with Fireworkz' buttons and menus.
    </p>

    <h4>Applying a style</h4>

    <p>
        The style of the main body of text in the letter you are editing looks fine
        and does not need changing. However the heading could be made to stand out
        more.
    </p>

    <p>To change the style of the heading:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the text you want to change, in this case the paragraph
            ‘VISIT TO PANTOMIME’.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Styles</span> dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose the style you want from the list by clicking on it.
            In this case, choose the
            <span class="csg-list-option">Heading</span> entry.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Apply</span> button in the dialogue box.
            The selected text will now appear in the chosen style.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Applying effects</h4>

    <p>
        Emphasis may be added to text using bold and italic forms of the letters.
        If you have used a typewriter, you will be used to underlining words for
        emphasis, or to show that they are the title of a work of art.
        It has become conventional with word processors such as Fireworkz to use
        italic letters to do this.
    </p>

    <p>To put the name of the pantomime in italics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Double-click on the word Cinderella in the first paragraph, so that it is
            selected.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_italic_out.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Italic</span> button on the toolbar.
            The word will appear in italics.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Checking your work</h2>

    <p>
        Everybody makes typing errors from time to time. To help you avoid making
        mistakes, Fireworkz includes a spelling checker which will read your document
        and query any words it thinks you might have spelt wrongly.
    </p>

    <p>To check the spelling in this document:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            If there is a current selection, clear it by clicking the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Selection</span> button on the toolbar.
        </li>

        <li>
            Open the
            <span class="csg-menu">Text &gt; Spell</span> submenu from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Extra</span> menu, and choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Check</span> option.
        </li>

        <li>
            The spelling checker will initially pick up parts of the address
            which are words that it does not recognise. Bypass these by clicking the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Next</span> button in the dialogue box
            which appears, until you come to the first real mistake, ‘atending’.
        </li>

        <li>The spelling checker will pick up the first spelling mistake and display  the word ‘atending’ in the top field of the dialogue box.</li>

        <li>
            Select the correct spelling -
            <span class="csg-list-option">attending</span> - from the list of
            suggested correct spellings, and click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Replace</span> button.
        </li>

        <li>
            If there are any more spelling mistakes, correct them as the spelling
            checker reports them to you.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Printing your work</h2>

    <p>
        The final phase in the production of most documents is printing them out,
        and this is no exception.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Ensure that you have installed and set up a printer driver on your
            system.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_print.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Print</span> button on the toolbar.
        </li>

        <li>
            The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Print</span> dialogue box appears.
        </li>

        <li>You want to print one copy of the document, so there is no need to alter any of the settings in the dialogue box.</li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button and the document should be
            printed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If there are any problems with printing, refer to the chapter on
        Printing in the <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>What you should do next</h2>

    <p>
