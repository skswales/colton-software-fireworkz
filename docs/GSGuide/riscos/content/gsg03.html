    <h1><span class="csg-chapter-number">3 </span>The basics</h1>

    <p>This chapter will describe some of the fundamental features of Fireworkz on RISC OS.</p>
    <p>It includes sections on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The mouse.</li>
        <li>The document window.</li>
        <li>The title bar.</li>
        <li>The toolbar.</li>
        <li>The status line.</li>
        <li>The rulers.</li>
        <li>Menus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The mouse</h2>

    <p>
        The three buttons on your mouse each perform separate functions,
        and their names reflect this.
        Their names are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Left mouse button: <strong>Select</strong></li>
        <li>Middle mouse button: <strong>Menu</strong></li>
        <li>Right mouse button: <strong>Adjust</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Many actions using the mouse are performed by <strong>clicking</strong> or
        <strong>double-clicking</strong> an object.
        To do this, position the pointer over the required object
        (e.g. the Fireworkz application icon) and press and
        release <strong>Select</strong> (the left mouse button) once or twice respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pressing <strong>Menu</strong> (the middle mouse button) with the pointer inside a Fireworkz
        window displays the main application menu, from which you may choose an
        option by pointing at it and clicking with the <strong>Select</strong> button.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Adjust</strong> (the right mouse button) can be used to access some
        short-cuts and more sophisticated functions.
    </p>

    <h2>The document window</h2>

    <p>
        When you use Fireworkz to create a new document or load an
        existing document, the document will appear in a window on your desktop.
        For example:
        <img src="images/the_13.png" alt="Example document window" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;">
    </p>

    <p>
        The central area in white represents the paper onto which you can enter your document.
        Anything inside this area will appear when your document is printed, anything outside this area will not appear.
    </p>

    <p>The other areas of the window are explained briefly below.</p>

    <h2>The title bar</h2>

    <p>The title bar of your document window includes some helpful information about your document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have saved the document, its full file and path name is shown.</li>

        <li>
            If the document is new, the name of the template on which it is based is shown.
            (Templates are used to defined how a document will be displayed -
            some templates are provided with Fireworkz and you can create others yourself.
            More information about use of templates is given in the <em>User Guide</em>.)
        </li>

        <li>If the document has been modified since it was last saved, an asterisk will be displayed.</li>

        <li>
            If you have a number of open windows belonging to the same document,
            the title of the document will contain a numeral indicating the number of views.
        </li>

        <li>
            If the document is not being viewed at full size (i.e. at a scale other than 100%),
            the scale being used in that view will be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The title bar also contains buttons at the left and right to control the window:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Back button.
            Used to send the window to the bottom of the display stack.
        </li>

        <li>
            Close button.
            Used to close the window.
            When closing the last view of a modified
            Fireworkz document, you will be asked whether or not you wish to save
            the document before closing it, or simply discard your changes and
            close the window.
        </li>

        <li>
            Iconise button.
            Used to remove the window from the display to the Pinboard.
        </li>

        <li>
            Toggle Size button.
            Used to make the window as large as possible on the display,
            and then to restore its original size from maximised.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>The toolbar</h2>

    <p>
        The toolbar along the top allows you to access all the most
        commonly used commands quickly and easily by a single click on a tool button.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/tbar.png" alt="Toolbar" style="border: 1px solid #EEE">
    </p>

    <h3>Greyed out (disabled) tool buttons</h3>
    <p>
        From time to time, certain tool buttons may be greyed out to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> tool button
        to remove an area of your document uness you have an area selected.
        Therefore, if you do not have an area selected, the tool button will be greyed out.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/cut_d.png" alt="Cut tool button (unavailable)" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; width:48px; height:48px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as you select an area, the tool button will become available for use.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/cut.png" alt="Cut tool button (available)" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; width:48px; height:48px;">
    </p>

    <h3>'Pressed in' tool buttons</h3>
    <p>
        Certain tool buttons may appear to be 'pressed in' or 'pushed out' to
        indicate whether or not particular options are currently selected.
        For example, if the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> tool button appears 'pressed in'
        (i.e. bold is currently selected)
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/boldon.png" alt="Bold tool button (pressed in)" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; width:48px; height:48px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        then any text which you type will appear in a bold font.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the tool button appears 'pushed out' (i.e. bold is not currently selected)
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/bold.png" alt="Bold tool button (pushed out)" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; width:48px; height:48px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        then text will appear in normal font weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> tool button,
        it will alternate between these two states.
    </p>

    <h3>The toolbar in Fireworkz Pro</h3>
    <p>
        The toolbar will change depending on the type of work you area doing.
        If you are in the middle of writing a letter,
        the word processing and spreadsheet tool buttons will be available.
        However, if you are currently within an area of your document which contains a database,
        then the database tool buttons will appear.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/tbardb.png" alt="Toolbar (Database)" style="border: 1px solid #EEE">
    </p>

    <h2>The status line</h2>

    <p>
        The status line appears below the toolbar.
        It provides help and information about the work in progress.
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you point the mouse pointer over control areas of the
            window, such as the toolbar, a message appears explaining
            the function of the tool button.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you drag the paragraph markers in the ruler.
            the precise measurements are shown in the selected unit of measurement,
            enabling you to align text and paragraphs precisely.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you perform certain operations, such as word counts,
            the results are displayed on the status line until the mouse pointer is moved again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fireworkz Pro: If you click in a database cell within your document,
            the number of records in the database will be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Whilst you are familiarising yourself with how Fireworkz works,
        you should make use of the help provided by the status line.
    </p>

    <h2>The rulers</h2>

    <p>There are two rulers that you can choose to display:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A horizontal ruler along the top of the document.</li>
        <li>A vertical ruler down the left-hand side of the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Horizontal ruler</h3>
    <p>The horizontal ruler can be used to alter the:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paragraph margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of the first line of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Left margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of subsequent lines of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Right margin - this determines the position of the right-hand edge of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Tab positions - these determined where text will appear when it is preceded by one or more Tab characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vertical ruler</h3>
    <p>The vertical ruler can be used to alter the:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Header margin - this determines the distance between the top of the paper and the printable area.</li>
        <li>Header offset - this determines the distance between the top of the printable area and the header text (if present).</li>
        <li>Footer margin - this determines the distance between the bottom of the paper and the printable area.</li>
        <li>Footer offset - this determines the distance between the bottom of the printable area and the footer text (if present).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Menus</h2>

    <p>
        If you point within the document window and click the Menu button,
        the Fireworkz menu will appear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several menus contain sub-menus (or simple dialogue boxes); these are indicated by the right-pointing
        arrow alongside the option name. These sub-menus may be accessed by sliding the
        mouse pointer off the right-hand side of the menu past the right-pointing arrow;
        this will cause the sub-menu (or simple dialogue box) to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other options can be chosen by pointing at them so that they
        are highlighted and then clicking <span class="csg-mouse-button">Select</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an option has an ellipsis (&hellip;) to its right,
        this indicates that the command needs to pop-up a more complex dialogue box
        that cannot operate as a standard RISC OS Window Manager dialogue-box-as-menu.
        Typically these will be dialogue boxes which present lists of items for selection.
        The ellipsis on such menu options is omitted in this document for brevity.
    </p>
    <p>Some frequently used menu options have keyboard shortcuts which are shown alongside the option name in each menu.</p>

    <h4>Greyed out (disabled) menu options</h4>

    <p>
        From time to time, certain menu options may be greyed out (disabled)
        to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        to sort an area of your document unless you have an area selected.
        If you do not have an area selected, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        will be greyed out. As soon as you select an area, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        will no longer be greyed out.
    </p>
