    <h1><div class="csg-section-number">2</div>Installation</h1>

    <p>This chapter provides a brief guide to installing Fireworkz on your computer.</p>

    <h2>Installing Fireworkz on RISC OS</h2>

    <p>Fireworkz may be installed on any version of RISC OS 3.1 or later.</p>

    <p>
        If you have a RISC OS 3, 4 or 6 system, you may need to update your
        <code>!System</code> with 32-bit support modules before running !Fireworkz;
        please see the Release Notes for instructions on how to do this.
    </p>

    <p>
        The easiest way to obtain and install Fireworkz for RISC OS is using
        <code>!PackMan</code>. You will most likely find this application
        in your <var>Apps.Admin</var> directory.
    </p>

    <p>It is recommended that you select the following set of packages for installation:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>Fireworkz</code></li>
        <li><code>Fireworkz-Examples</code></li>
        <li><code>Fireworkz-Manuals</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <code>Fireworkz</code>: The <code>!Fireworkz</code> application
        will be installed into your <var>Apps.Documents</var> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>Fireworkz-Examples</code>: The associated example files for Fireworkz
        will be installed into your <var>Apps.Documents</var> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>Fireworkz-Manuals</code>: The <em>Getting Started Guide</em> and the <em>User Guide</em> for Fireworkz
        will be installed into your <var>Manuals</var> directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Installing Fireworkz Pro on RISC OS</h2>

    <p>Fireworkz Pro for RISC OS may be purchased from R-Comp.</p>

    <p>Please follow the instructions supplied with Fireworkz Pro.</p>

    <h2>Printer drivers</h2>

    <p>
        Before you can print from Fireworkz you will need to have a printer driver
        loaded. This is a standard piece of system software which your computer uses to
        handle printing for all applications which use fonts or pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first time you use a printer driver you may need to configure it for
        your particular printer. Please pay particular attention to the page size
        settings, which often default to American paper sizes, and check that they are
        appropriate for your printer and the paper you wish to use most frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the page size settings are wrong in the printer driver, in particular if
        they are too big, it is almost certain that when you print from Fireworkz, you
        will have problems with either your text being cropped (missing lines of text
        or characters from the top, bottom or sides of the page) or find that your
        printer keeps feeding through blank pages. Spending a little extra time at the
        start ensuring your printer driver is set up corrrectly may save you many
        frustrating hours of incorrect printing later on.
