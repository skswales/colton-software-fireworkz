    <p>
        This chapter is intended to introduce you to some of Fireworkz' powerful
        and advanced features. You should find that they are no harder to use than the
        basic features you learned in the last chapter.
    </p>

    <p>Topics covered include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Adding new styles and update existing styles;</li>

        <li>
            Layering styles to provide a combination of changes,
            including colour, emphasis and typeface;
        </li>

        <li>Using effects to provide one-off changes;</li>

        <li>Using the ruler and markers to update styles;</li>

        <li>Creating and editing tables;</li>

        <li>Resizing columns in tables;</li>

        <li>Adding colour and borders to tables.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The example documents in this chapter were designed to work on A4 paper.
        If the printer which you will be using does not print on A4 but a
        different length or width of paper, you will need to tell Fireworkz this
        before you start.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that your printer driver has been installed correctly.</li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Paper...</span> from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Page</span> menu.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Read printer</span> button, then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This process will ensure that the document is formatted correctly for your
        printer, using the information stored in your printer driver.
    </p>

    <p>
        See the chapter in the <em>User Guide</em> on Printing
        for further details of setting up your printer driver.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the style editor</h2>

    <p>
        The style editor is one of Fireworkz' most powerful features. It is well
        worth learning to use how to use the style editor to get the best out of the
        program. Styles are a powerful tool for formatting your text and documents.
        They enable you to tag similar things such as all the headings in your
        document, and apply the same typeface, size, and margins and so on to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        This makes designing your document quicker, because you only have to set up
        a style once and then it can be quickly applied to any text. It also
        ensures that your documents are consistent, because when you change a style
        Fireworkz automatically changes all text which appears in that style.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before you start to edit styles and create new styles, you should
        familiarise yourself with the style editor by looking at some of the styles in
        the document you will be working on.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Load the example document <var>Newsletter</var> from the
            <var>Tutorials</var> directory.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Styles</span>
            dialogue box will appear, containing a list of styles.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <var>BaseLetter</var> entry (this is the base style for this document) in the
            list to select it and then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Change</span> button. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Editing Style</span>
            dialogue box (referred to as the style editor) will appear.

            <br /><span>
                The style editor is divided into a number of
                different sections which you can reach by clicking on the radio button next to
                their title. The green button next to each radio button simply indicates that
                something has been selected in that section of the style editor. They do not do
                anything except help you find out what attributes a style has.
                The first green button is always on as every style has a name.
            </span>

            <br /><span>
                You will see that in this case all the green
                buttons at the left-hand edge of the style editor are illuminated. This is
                because you are editing a base style that provides default values for all
                style attributes in this document.
            </span>

            <br /><span>
                If a style which does not have all the settings
                active is applied to a section of text, the text will retain the existing
                settings for those attributes which are not set in the style which you are
                applying.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Cancel</span> button.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar
            again, but this time choose
            <span class="csg-list-option">Bold</span> from the list of styles.

            <br /><span>
                You will see that this style
                has only one active section,
                <span class="csg-dbox-option">Text</span>, and that this has only one option, the bold typeface option, set.
            </span>

            <br /><span>
                The left-hand button of this option indicates
                whether the style affects the boldness of the text - in this case the option is
                set so the boldness is affected. The right-hand button of this option indicates
                what the effect is - in this case the button is in the on position and so text
                to which this style is applied would be made bold. (If the right-hand button
                had been in the off position, the effect of applying the style would be to
                remove any occurrence of bold text which it encountered.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        You should spend some time looking at the options in the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Style</span>
        dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do not understand any of the terms used, they are all
        defined in the Glossary at the end of the <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a new style</h3>

    <p>
        The newsletter does not have a style for headings. Headings currently
        appear in the same style as the main text (referred to as the body text).
    </p>

    <p>To add a new style:</p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar,
            then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">New</span> button. The
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Define new style</span> dialogue box will appear:
        </li>

        <img src="images/dbox_new_style.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding: 10px;" /></li>

        <li>Type <span class="csg-user-text">Heading</span> in the space for the style name.</li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-list-option">BaseLetter</span> from the list of styles.
            It is usual to base new styles on attributes from an existing one.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
            A new dialogue box will appear with the title
            <span class="csg-dbox">Defining new style - Heading</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
            If necessary, click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Text</span> button to go to the part of the
            <span class="csg-dbox">Style</span> dialogue box where you can alter
            aspects of the text style.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_bold.png" />
        <li>
            You will be making the type bold and increasing its size. So you need to
            click on the check box next to the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Bold</span> button. Both it and the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Bold</span> button will be pressed in.
            Next, click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Height</span> check box.
            Use the arrows to increase the size to 16 points.
        </li>

        <img src="images/newsletter_35.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding: 10px;" /></li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The new style, <var>Heading</var>, is now added to the list of styles in this document.</p>

    <p>
        If you click the
        <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar
        you will see that <var>Heading</var> is now included in the list of styles.
    </p>

    <h4>Applying your new style to existing text</h4>

    <p>
        There are several headings already in the document to which you need to
        apply the Heading style. To do this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Go to the first heading, ‘Latest news from your youth club
            and community centre.’, and select it.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-list-option">Heading</span> from the list of styles
            and then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Apply</span> button. The heading will appear in bold and in larger text.
        </li>

        <li>Go through the other headings in the document and do the same to them.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Note that the best way to create your document is to enter the text and then
        to add the styles to it afterwards, as described above.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can, if you wish, set up a style to be applied to text which you are
        about to enter at the current caret position by choosing a style from the list
        and clicking the
        <span class="csg-dbox-button">Apply</span> button when no text is selected.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing styles without using the dialogue box</h3>

    <p>
        There are some aspects of style which are much more easily set up or
        changed by working on the page with the buttons and ruler markers than by going
        through the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Style</span> dialogue box and typing in numbers.
        Setting margins and tabs are the main example.
    </p>

    <p>
        The list of points at the bottom of the page need to be indented (moved
        towards the centre of the page) further than they are already. To change the
        style:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_selection_off.png" />
        <li>
            Place the caret in the line beginning ‘Junior disco’. But make sure that
            you do not select any text; you can check this by looking at the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Selection</span> button on the toolbar,
            which should be white.
        </li>

        <li>
            Point at the left margin marker, and drag it one centimetre to the right.
            The paragraph margin marker and tabs will follow it. Note that the status line
            will tell you which style you are altering, in this case <var>Points</var>.
            All three paragraphs which are in this style will be reformatted.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you attempt to change a style while there is a selection, your changes
        will be applied as an effect to the selected area. An effect is like a one-off
        occurrence of a style, but no record of it is stored in the Style list so it
        is harder for you to keep control of your document and go back and make
        consistent stylistic changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Layering styles</h3>

    <p>
        One of the most powerful things you can do with styles is to combine them
        with each other to add further dimensions of style to your documents.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make this easy, you should define as little as possible in each style.
        For example, styles changing the colour of text should not also change the
        typeface or text size. This makes it easy to build combinations of styles,
        giving you added flexibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        You have already applied one style, <var>Heading</var>, to the headings in
        the document. Now go back to them and layer another style over them to add
        colour.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Select a heading and click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-list-option">Text colour</span> from the list of styles
            and click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Apply</span> button. The text will change to the new colour but remain in the same typeface.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Applying effects</h2>

    <p>
        If there is a change in appearance which you wish to make consistently
        throughout your document, for example changing all headings to be a
        larger size, then you should use a style for this.
        However, if there is a change which you know is only going to occur once,
        then it will be quicker to make the change by applying an effect.
    </p>

    <p>To apply an effect:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Selected the area of text you wish to change, in this case the words lighting system in the second paragraph.</li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_effects.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Effects</span> button on the toolbar. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Apply effects</span> dialogue box will appear.
            This is like the
            <span class="csg-dbox">Style</span> dialogue box.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Text</span> button, enable the
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Colour</span> option and choose any colour
            from those available.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. The text selected will
            immediately be changed to the colour that you chose.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Like styles, effects created using the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Apply effects</span> dialogue box will be added to
        the selected region, if there is one. If there is no region selected, any
        attributes which you set will affect any new text which you enter at the
        current caret position.
    </p>

    <h3>Special effect buttons</h3>

    <p>
        Buttons are provided on the toolbar for the most commonly used effects; bold,
        italic, underline, superscript and subscript:
    <p>

        <img src="images/tbar_biuss.png" style="padding-left: 32px; padding-top: 10px;" />
    </p>

    <p>
        As usual, you can select a region and click one of these toolbar buttons to
        apply the corresponding effect to that region.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, you can click one of these toolbar buttons when no region is
        selected to have the effect apply to new text at the current caret position.
        The button will appear to be pressed in, to remind you that any text which you
        enter will appear in the corresponding style. To revert back to normal type, simply click the toolbar button again to deselect it.
    </p>

    <p>For example, you need to add another text paragraph to the newsletter:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the caret at the end of the paragraph which starts
            ‘Thanks to everyone...’ and press
            <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span>.
            The caret will now be at the start of a new paragraph.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_bold.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> button on the toolbar. You will see that bold is now selected.
        </li>

        <li>
            Type in:

            <blockquote class="csg-user-text">Also thanks</blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> button on the toolbar again. You will see that bold is no longer selected.
        </li>

        <li>
            Type in:

            <blockquote class="csg-user-text">to the Parent and Toddler group for raising &pound;145 with the sponsored tricycle ride.</blockquote>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        You will see that the first two words appeared in bold and the rest in the
        ordinary base text style.
    </p>



    <h2>Adding tables</h2>

    <p>
        Tables are a useful way of setting out complicated information which would
        be hard to understand if it was written in sentences. But Fireworkz' table
        facilities offer much more than that. They allow you to create a wide range of
        custom forms and similar documents.
    </p>

    <p>
        To being working with tables, open the document <var>Form</var>
        in the <var>Tutorial</var> directory.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding the table</h3>

    <p>To add a table to the end of the document:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Position the caret at the end of the text in the document and press
            <span class="csg-key">Return&crarr;</span> to start a new paragraph.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_table.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Table</span> button on the toolbar
            or choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Table...</span> option from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Edit</span> menu. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">Insert table</span>
            dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            Enter <span class="csg-user-text">5</span> for the number of columns and <span class="csg-user-text">6</span> for the
            number of rows, then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. The table will be added
            to the document. At this stage it will be very plain and not include much of
            the style detailing which you are going to add.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Each <em>cell</em> in the table can hold either text or a number. They are
        all initialised as though they will be holding numbers. However, in this
        example some will be holding text. This is not a problem, as Fireworkz will
        change the cell type depending on what you enter into it. But, it does mean
        that when you first move to a cell, the caret may not appear immediately.
    </p>

    <p>To help keep track of where you are within a table, follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_view_control.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">View control</span> button at the
            top left of the toolbar. The
            <span class="csg-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Column border</span> and
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Row border</span> options.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. Borders will appear along
            the top and left-hand side of the document showing the positions of the
            individual columns and rows in your table. The current cell is indicated by
            which column and row appear highlighted in the borders. Initially, the current
            cell will be the top, left-hand cell of the table.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Adding text to the table</h3>

    <p>You will need to type the following text into your table.</p>

    <table border="1" class="csg-sample-indent">
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <col />
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">Activity</td>
            <td valign="top">Planned<br />dates</td>
            <td valign="top">Approx.<br />cost</td>
            <td valign="top">Interested</td>
            <td valign="top">Preferred<br />date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Abseiling</td>
            <td>5, 12, 19</td>
            <td>&pound;5</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Canoeing</td>
            <td>6, 13, 20</td>
            <td>&pound;10</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hiking</td>
            <td>1, 8, 15</td>
            <td>&pound;3</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pony trekking</td>
            <td>2-3, 9-10</td>
            <td>&pound;20</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Potholing</td>
            <td>14, 20</td>
            <td>&pound;5</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Use the arrow keys to move from cell to cell. As you do so, the currently
            highlighted column and row will change to indicate where you are.
        </li>

        <li>
            Notice how the rows increase in depth automatically to accommodate the
            text.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resizing columns</h3>

    <p>To improve the appearance of your table looking just you need to change the width of some of the columns.</p>

    <p>
        The last column, ‘Preferred date’, needs to be quite wide because people
        will be writing in it. To widen the column:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret somewhere within the column.</li>

        <li>
            Point at the column width marker in the ruler (vertical bars).
            The mouse pointer will turn into the two-way horizontal arrows,
            and the status line will confirm that you are pointing at
            a column width marker and give you the current column width measurement.
        </li>

        <li>Press down and hold the left mouse button and drag the marker to the right for about two centimetres.</li>

        <li>Release the mouse button and the column will be resized.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In some cases you want to make sure that the column is just the right
        size for the text it contains. This feature is called <em>Auto width</em>.
        To resize the first column automatically:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Position the caret in the first column.</li>

        <li>
            Point at the column width marker in the ruler.
            The mouse pointer will turn into the two-way horizontal arrows.
        </li>

        <li>Double-click on the column width marker. The column will resize automatically to the correct width for the widest text which it contains.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Adding colour</h3>

    <p>
        Tables can sometimes be difficult to read. Adding colour is one way of
        making it easier for people to keep their eyes on a particular row or column.
    </p>

    <p>To add colour to the table:</p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar,
            create a new style, and give it the name <var>Table colour</var>
        </li>

        <li>
            Go to the
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Colours</span> section of the
            <span class="csg-dbox">Defining new style</span> dialogue box, and click on
            <span class="csg-dbox-option">Background</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose a background colour for the table. Bear in mind that it will have
            text printed over it, so it should be a fairly pale colour.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.
        </li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
        <li>
            Now select all the cells in the first column of the table, and click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose
            <span class="csg-list-option">Table colour</span> from the list of styles
            and then click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Apply</span> button.
        </li>

        <li>Repeat the two previous steps to add this style to the cells in the top row of the table.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        One possibility is to add colour to alternate columns or rows, or to groups
        of rows or columns. This can be done using one of the supplied template styles such as <var>ColStripe</var> in the <var>Styles</var> directory - this would require you to consult the <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Adding a border</h3>

    <p>
        You can add further definition to your table by adding a heavier rule
        around its outer edge. To do this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Select all the cells in the table.</li>

        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_box.png" />
        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Box</span> button on the toolbar,
            or choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Box</span> option from the
            <span class="csg-menu">Style</span> menu.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Outside</span> button in the
            <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the thick line button in the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Line style</span> section.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. A thicker line will be drawn around the outside of the table.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        You can also use the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box to add thinner lines within
        tables, or to change the colour of lines in tables.
    </p>

    <p>
        To remove lines from a table, choose the blank button in the
        <span class="csg-dbox-button">Line style</span> section of the
        <span class="csg-dbox">Box</span> dialogue box.
    </p>

    <h2>Saving your work</h2>

    <p>The final step in the tutorial is to save your work.</p>

    <ol>
        <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_save.png" />
        <li>
            If you were to click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Save</span> button on the toolbar this
            modified document would be saved to its current location.
            However, for this example, you should try to save your document
            onto another disc or in another directory.
        </li>

        <li>
            Choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Save as&hellip;</span> option from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.
        </li>

        <li>
            The standard
            <span class="csg-dbox">Save</span>
            dialogue box will appear.
        </li>

        <li>Choose the drive and directory where you want to save the file.</li>

        <li>
            Enter a name for the document, such as <span class="csg-user-text">Form2016</span>.
            You must make sure that the document is saved with type
            <span class="csg-list-option">Fireworkz document (*.fwk)</span> as this
            enables your system to directly associate it with Fireworkz.
        </li>

        <li>
            Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button. The file will be saved.
        </li>
    </ol>
