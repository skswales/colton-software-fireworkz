<h1>Getting started with spreadsheets</h1>

<p>This chapter provides an introduction to the basic spreadsheet features
which Fireworkz contains. If you are new to using Fireworkz or to using
spreadsheets, you should work through this chapter.</p>

<p>Topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cells in spreadsheets;</li>

<li>Entering text and numbers;</li>

<li>Adding up columns and rows;</li>

<li>Formatting numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Loading the document</h2>

<p>Load the example document <var>Accounts</var> from the
<var>Tutorials</var> directory. The following window will appear:

<img src="images/accounts_46.png" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" /></p>

<p>The file contains the simplified accounts of a small business. Some
categories of information have already been entered. However, not all the
details have been filled in. You will be entering more text and numbers to the
spreadsheet and performing some calculations to add up the columns of
figures.</p>

<h3>Cells</h3>

<p>Each piece of information appears in a box called a <em>cell</em>.
Some cells contain text, and others contain numbers. The two types of cell
behave in slightly different ways, as you will see when you work with them.</p>

<p>In this spreadsheet, the cells around the top and left-hand edges of the
page are text cells, and the others are number cells. You do not have to 
define cells to be one type or another - Fireworkz does this for you
automatically, depending on what you type into the cells. Similarly, if
you edit a cell and change its contents from a number to a piece of text or
vice versa, Fireworkz will automatically change the cell type.</p>

<h3>Cell references</h3>

<p>Within each spreadsheet each column and row has a unique heading
letter or number. This enables each cell to have a unique address, formed by
its column and row identifiers. For example, the cell at the intersection of
column <strong>A</strong> and row <strong>9</strong> is referred to as
cell <strong>A9</strong>.</p>

<p>Many operations you carry out in a spreadsheet are done by entering a
<em>function</em> in one cell, and giving it the cell reference(s) of the cell
(or cells) containing the data. The function is a command which performs an
operation on the data, such as adding it up, or working out the average.
The cell containing the function then displays the result of performing that
calculation on that data.</p>

<h3>Current cell</h3>

<p>To enter text, a number or a function into a cell you need have to make
that cell the current cell. You can tell which is the current cell in a number
of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The row and column headings will be emphasised.</li>

<li>A border will appears around the cell.</li>

<li>You may be able to see the caret in the cell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entering text</h2>

<p>When you enter text into a text cell, you type it straight on to the
spreadsheet page.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click once on cell A9 and it will become the current cell. Note that the
column heading <var>A</var> and row heading <var>9</var> are emphasised and
that the cell has a border around it.</li>

<li>Type in the word <kbd>Travel</kbd> and press
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span>.</li>

<li>The cell beneath, A10, will then become the current cell.
Type in the word <kbd>Total</kbd> and press
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Entering numbers</h2>

<p>As you can see, there are still a lot of blanks in the number section of the spreadsheet to fill in before you can calculate the totals.</p>

<h3>Entering single numbers</h3>

<p>Numbers are entered in the same way as text:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on cell B9</li>

<li>Type in the number <kbd>60</kbd> and press
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span>. You will see 60 entered in cell B9.

<div class="csguide-li-div">Note that numbers are right-justified by default,
so that the columns of digits line up correctly.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Enter some more numbers into the following cells:</p>

<table style="margin-left: 5em;">
  <col />
  <col width="20em;" />
  <col />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Cell</th>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Number</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C9</td>
      <th> </th>
      <td><kbd>65</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D9</td>
      <th> </th>
      <td><kbd>60</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E9</td>
      <th> </th>
      <td><kbd>70</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E7</td>
      <th> </th>
      <td><kbd>65</kbd></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Editing numbers</h3>

<p>Two of the existing numbers need correcting. There are two methods of
editing numbers, each of which will be covered below.</p>

<h4>Using the formula line</h4>

<p>The first method is to use the <em>formula line</em> - this is the large
blank area at the right of the top row of buttons on the toolbar:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on cell E6. The cell will become the current cell as usual.
In addition, the value held in the cell will appear in the formula line.</li>

<li>Move the caret to the formula line by clicking at the end of the number in
the formula line or by pressing
<span class="csguide-key">F2</span>.</li>

<li>Delete the existing number and replace it by 85. As you type, you will see
that the contents of the cell do not alter - only the formula line changes.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_tick.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Tick</span> button on the toolbar or press
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span> to update the spreadsheet. You will see the new value 85 appear in cell E6.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using in-cell editing</h4>

<p>Another, simpler, method of altering numbers is to use
<em>in-cell editing</em>. This allows you to change the numbers directly in
the cells as though they were text.</p>

<p>To turn on in-cell editing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose the
<span class="csguide-menu-option">Choices</span> option from the
<span class="csguide-menu">File</span> menu.</li>

<li>Set the
<span class="csguide-dbox-option">Edit in cell</span> option in the
<span class="csguide-dbox-option">Spreadsheet</span> section of the
<span class="csguide-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box by clicking on it.</li>

<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, editing numbers becomes much simpler.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on cell E4. The cell will become the current cell and the caret will
appear in the cell.</li>

<li>Delete the existing number and replace it with -50. The minus sign in this
example indicates that money has been received rather than paid out (i.e. a
rent rebate has been received).</li>

<li>Press
<span class="csguide-key">Return</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the negative value appears in red. The base style being used
specifies that negative numbers should be preceded by a minus sign and also
have the Negative style applied to them. If you examine the Negative style,
you will see that it is defined to display text in red.</p>

<p>When you have decided which of the methods of editing numbers that you
prefer, you should set or clear the
<span class="csguide-dbox-option">Edit in cell</span> option of the
<span class="csguide-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box as appropriate, then
click the
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">Save</span> button. Then, whenever you start
up Fireworkz, your selected method will be the default.</li>

<h3>Copying numbers</h3>

<p>Cell E8 is still blank. However, the number to enter there, 40, is the same
as the number in cell C8. Rather than type in a new number, you can copy the
number from cell C8 to E8.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the contents of cell C8 by double-clicking in the cell.
The cell will be highlighted to indicate that it is selected.

<div class="csguide-li-div">If you have in-cell editing on, the dark
background will appear behind the digits only, and will not cover the entire
cell.</div>
</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_copy.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Copy</span> button on the toolbar.
Nothing obvious will appear to happen but a copy of the number will be
stored internally by the computer. It will be remembered until you cut orcopy another piece of text or number or exit Fireworkz.</li>

<li>Click on cell E8. It now becomes the current cell.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_paste.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Paste</span> button on the toolbar.
The number 40 will now appear in cell E8.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Entering blocks of numbers</h2>

<p>You will notice that you still have not entered the figures for the Rates in
row 5. This is a fixed cost, the same every quarter. You do not have to enter
the number in every cell individually.
Instead you can <em>fill</em> the cells.</p>

<h3>Selecting a range</h3>

<p>To fill a group of cells you must first select the group of cells to fill.
Groups of contiguous cells are called <em>ranges</em>. There are two methods
of selecting a range of cells.</p>

<p>The first way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Point at the first cell in the range you want to select (in this case cell B5).</li>

<li>Press and hold down the left mouse button and drag the pointer to the last
cell in the range you want to select (in this case cell E5).</li>

<li>When you can see that all the cells in the range you want to select are
highlighted, release the left mouse button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Position the caret in the first cell in the range you want to select (in this case cell B5).</li>

<li>Point at the last cell in the range you want to select (in this case cell E5) and click the left mouse button whilst holding down the
<span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> key. The cells in the range will be
highlighted.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Filling cells</h3>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_fill_down.png" />
<p>When a range is selected, the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Fill down</span> and
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Fill right</span> buttons on the
toolbar become illuminated to indicate that they are available.</p>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_fill_right.png" />
<p>These buttons enable you to enter the same number into several cells at once.</p>

<p>The data to copy must appear in the first cell in the range, either the
top cell selected for
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Fill down</span> or the
left-hand cell selected for
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Fill right</span>
(as in the current example).</p>

<ol>
<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_fill_right.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Fill right</span> button on the toolbar.
You will see the number 150 appear in all the selected cells.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_selection_on.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Selection</span> button on the toolbar
to remove the selection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your spreadsheet should now look like this:

<img src="images/accounts_51.png" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" /></p>

<h2>Adding numbers</h2>

<p>There are some blank spaces left in the spreadsheet for the totals. Adding up
columns and rows of numbers is one of the most common operations performed
with spreadsheets. Because it is so useful, there is a button on the toolbar
to enable you to total columns or rows automatically.</p>

<p>To do this, all you need do is select the cells you want to total, plus a
blank cell at the end to display the result in.</p>

<p>For example, to add together the numbers in column B:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the range of cells B4 to B10 as described above.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_auto_sum.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Autosum</span> button on the the toolbar.
The figure 885 will appear in cell B10.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to do the same for columns C, D and E.
You can speed this up even further as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the range of cells C4 to E10.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_auto_sum.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Autosum</span> button on the toolbar.
Fireworkz will automatically total each of the columns and display the
three resulting values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you need to add the contents of rows 4 to 10.
You can do this in one operation as above:</p>

<ol>
<li>Selecting the range of cells B4 to F10.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_auto_sum.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Autosum</span> button on the toolbar.
Column F will now contain the totals of each row and,
in cell F10, the grand total.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you click on cell F10, you will be able to see in the formula line the
way that the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Autosum</span> button works.
The formula line will read:</p>

<blockquote><kbd>sum(b10e10)</kbd></blockquote>

<p>The function which performed the operation is mentioned first, followed by
the cells on which it operated, in this case the range B10 to E10.</p>

<p>A slower but simpler method of getting the same result would have been to
type in the formula line</p>

<blockquote><kbd>b10 + c10 + d10 + e10</kbd></blockquote>

<p>But this would have taken much longer and is more prone to typing error.</p>

<p>Another benefit of using the sum() function is that if you later insert
extra columns into the range covered by the sum() function, it automatically
updates to include the extra columns.</p>

<h2>Applying styles and formats</h2>

<p>The spreadsheet is now full of data, but it is unformatted. You need to know
more about numbers than the numerals to understand them; if they are money,
what currency, if they are a percentage, and so on. Formatting the numbers
makes them easier to understand because you know more about what the numbers
represent, and about their size.</p>

<p>The numbers in this spreadsheet are, in fact, currency and should be
formatted as such.</p>

<p>Formats are applied to cells using the Style system. This is a feature of
Fireworkz which allows you to collect formatting information and give it a
name, and then choose the name from the list of styles to apply to any
section of your spreadsheet.</p>

<h3>Entering formatted numbers</h3>

<p>You could have entered all the numbers directly in a currency format.
For example, instead of typing <kbd>60</kbd> into a cell you could have typed
<kbd>&pound;60.00</kbd>. This would have been recognised by Fireworkz as being
a number entered in a known currency style.</p>

<h3>Applying styles</h3>

<p>Often, as in this example in which all the numbers represent currency,
it is quicker to enter them as unformatted integers and convert them all
to the same currency format afterwards:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the range of cells containing numbers, cells B4 to F10.</li>

<img class="csguide-lhs-img" src="images/tbar_style.png" />
<li>Click the
<span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Style</span> button on the toolbar.
You will see a list of available styles. Several styles have already been
defined in this document; it is possible to create new styles if you need them,
but the ones required for this example have already been set up.</li>

<li>Choose the style <var>Currency</var> from the list by clicking on
it.</li>

<li>Click
<span class="csguide-dbox-button">Apply</span>. The numbers will appear
reformatted with pound signs, two decimal places and commas indicating 
thousands where appropriate:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/accounts_55.png" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" /></p>
