<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>This chapter provides a brief guide to installing Fireworkz on your
computer.</p>

<h2>Installing Fireworkz on RISC OS</h2>

<p>Fireworkz may be installed on any version of RISC OS 3.1 or later.</p>

<p>If you have a RISC OS 3 or 4 system, you may need to update your
!System with 32-bit support modules before running !Fireworkz;
please see the Release Notes for instructions on how to do this.</p>

<p>The easiest way to obtain and install Fireworkz for RISC OS is using
!PackMan.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you select the set of packages:<br />
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Fireworkz</code>,<br />
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Fireworkz-Examples</code> and<br />
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>Fireworkz-Manuals</code><br />
for installation.</p>

<p>The !Fireworkz application and associated example files
will be installed into your <var>Apps.Documents</var> directory.</p>

<p>Fireworkz documentation (this Getting Started Guide and a combined User and
Spreadsheet Guide) will be installed into your <var>Manuals</var> directory.</p>

<h2>Installing Fireworkz Pro on RISC OS</h2>

<p>Fireworkz Pro for RISC OS may be purchased from R-Comp.</p>

<p>Please follow the instructions supplied with Fireworkz Pro.</p>

<h2>Printer drivers</h2>

<p>Before you can print from Fireworkz you will need to have a printer driver
loaded. This is a standard piece of system software which your computer uses to
handle printing for all applications which use fonts or pictures.</p>

<p>The first time you use a printer driver you may need to configure it for
your particular printer. Please pay particular attention to the page size
settings, which often default to American paper sizes, and check that they are
appropriate for your printer and the paper you wish to use most frequently.</p>

<p>If the page size settings are wrong in the printer driver, in particular if
they are too big, it is almost certain that when you print from Fireworkz, you
will have problems with either your text being cropped (missing lines of text
or characters from the top, bottom or sides of the page) or find that your
printer keeps feeding through blank pages. Spending a little extra time at the
start ensuring your printer driver is set up corrrectly may save you many
frustrating hours of incorrect printing later on.</p>
