<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>This chapter provides a brief guide to installing Fireworkz on your
computer.</p>

<h2>Installing Fireworkz on Windows</h2>

<p>Fireworkz may be installed on Windows© 10, Windows© 8.1, Windows© 7,
Windows Vista© or Windows© XP (SP3)</p>

<p>Fireworkz for Windows is supplied on the Colton Software web site as a
ZIP archive file. You should download this file to your computer and then
double-click on the ZIP archive file to expand its content.
You will see that it contains Release Notes and a setup executable.</p>

<p>To install Fireworkz, simply double-click on the setup_firewrkz_xxx.exe
file and follow the instructions in the dialogue boxes that follow.</p>

<p>Please note that you will need to have Administrator or Power User
permissions to install Fireworkz.</p>

<p>Most of the files that Fireworkz depends upon are stored in, or under,
the directory that you specify on installation.</p>

<p>The combined User and Spreadsheet Guide is used as the built-in on-line
help system in Fireworkz and is supplied as a CHM file. It is also
available in its HTML source form on the Colton Software web site.</p>

<p>The Examples files that are used in the tutorials in this
Getting Started Guide are also supplied on the Colton Software web site as a
ZIP archive file. You should download this file to your computer and then
right-click on it to extract its content to your own user's area on your hard
drive. This extracted content will be referred to in this Guide as the
<var>Examples</var> directory.</p>

<h2>Printer drivers</h2>

<p>Before you can print from Fireworkz you will need to have a printer driver
loaded. This is a standard piece of system software which your computer uses to
handle printing for all applications which use fonts or pictures.</p>

<p>The first time you use a printer driver you may need to configure it for
your particular printer. Please pay particular attention to the page size
settings, which often default to American paper sizes, and check that they are
appropriate for your printer and the paper you wish to use most frequently.</p>

<p>If the page size settings are wrong in the printer driver, in particular if
they are too big, it is almost certain that when you print from Fireworkz, you
will have problems with either your text being cropped (missing lines of text
or characters from the top, bottom or sides of the page) or find that your
printer keeps feeding through blank pages. Spending a little extra time at the
start ensuring your printer driver is set up corrrectly may save you many
frustrating hours of incorrect printing later on.</p>
