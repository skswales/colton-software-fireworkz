    <h2>About Fireworkz</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz is part of the Z family of
        applications from Colton Software.
        This family includes the stand-alone applications Wordz, Resultz and Recordz.
        These stand-alone applications were developed for systems with very little memory
        in the early 1990s and are no longer available separately.
    </p>

    <h4>Wordz</h4>

    <p>
        Wordz could be used alone as a word processor to write letters,
        reports, books, invitations, shopping lists, schedules and other
        documents.
    </p>

    <h4>Resultz</h4>

    <p>
        Resultz could be used alone as a spreadsheet to perform
        calculations, analyse figures, and produce colourful charts.
    </p>

    <h4>Recordz</h4>

    <p>
        Recordz could be used alone as a database to store and manage all
        kinds of data from school and business information to personal
        details about projects and collections.
    </p>

    <h4>Fireworkz</h4>

    <p>
        Fireworkz combines the features of Wordz and Resultz enabling you to do even
        more; incorporate live results in your reports, or perform an
        automatic mail-merge to your friends or customers, for example.
        Fireworkz is available on RISC OS and Microsoft Windows.
    </p>

    <h4>Fireworkz Pro</h4>

    <p>
        Fireworkz Pro further combines the database features of Recordz with
        the word processing features of Wordz and
        the spreadsheet facilities of Resultz
        enabling you to create fully integrated documents.
        Fireworkz Pro is only available on RISC OS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have learned to use one of these programs you will find
        it easy to use the other members of the family, because they share
        much of the same interface and have been designed to work well
        together. This is true even if you move from RISC OS to Windows
        or vice versa; the programs have been designed to be as similar as
        possible on each platform.
    </p>

    <h2>About this <em>Getting Started Guide</em></h2>

    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> includes all the information you need to
        start using Fireworkz on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is designed to give you an overall feel for how to use Fireworkz by taking you
        through several examples which you can try out on the computer as you are reading.
        The examples deal separately with word processing and spreadsheet use before a
        final example demonstrates Fireworkz&rsquo; capacity to combine the different sorts of work.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have used Fireworkz before or are an experienced user of other word processors, spreadsheets or database programs
        we recommend that you glance through the appropriate chapters before moving on to the main <em>User Guide</em>,
        where you will find more information about the program and its features.
        You will probably encounter features of Fireworkz which are new to you and
        you will get a feel for how Fireworkz differs from software that you have used before.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you haven&rsquo;t used this type of software before, we recommend that you work through all of the examples in the <em>Getting Started Guide</em>.
        As you do so, you will learn a lot about the different types of work Fireworkz can help you with.
        You will almost certainly discover ways of doing things which you hadn&rsquo;t imagined were possible.
        Whilst most people try to avoid reading software documentation if they can,
        a little extra time spent studying now can save you a lot of time later on.
    </p>

    <h3>Knowledge assumed</h3>

    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> assumes that you are already
        reasonably familiar with the way your computer works. If you are
        new to computing, you are advised to familiarise
        yourself both with the relevant terminology and the basics of
        using your computer. You will need to know how to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start up programs and open documents;</li>

        <li>View directories and copy files;</li>

        <li>Display menus and choose entries from them;</li>

        <li>Position and resize windows, minimise and restore windows;</li>

        <li>Scroll through documents using the scroll bars and arrows;</li>

        <li>
            Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen and to
            position the caret;
        </li>

        <li>Use the mouse buttons to click, double-click and drag objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You should understand terms such as directory, double-click
        and dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should be able to find all this information in the system documentation
        which came with your computer. The tutorial chapters in this <em>Getting Started
        Guide</em> also provide a reminder of these skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="gsggl.html">Glossary</a> gives a non-technical explanation of those terms
        used throughout the <em>Getting Started Guide</em> which you may not have come across before.
    </p>

    <h2>Text in this <em>Getting Started Guide</em></h2>

    <p>
        When working your way through the tutorial chapters, you will see that
        certain stylistic conventions are used to make it easier for you to see what
        you should do at each stage, what you should type in and what you should
        choose from menus.
    </p>

    <p>
        Certain buttons, options and commands always appear in the text in bold type.
        These include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Menu options.
            For example:<br>
              &lsquo;Choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> command from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            Action and option buttons in dialogue boxes.
            For example:<br>
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button-default"><span class="csg-dbox-button-core">Save</span></span> button.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            <img class="csg-lhs-img" src="images/toolbar/style.png" alt="Style tool button">
            Tool buttons on the toolbar.
            For example:<br>
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> tool button on the toolbar.&rsquo;<br>
            To the left, you also see a representation of that tool button.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In some places there is text for you to type in.
        This is always shown in a typewriter-style font, like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="csg-user-text">Type this text on your computer exactly as you see it.</blockquote>

    <p>
        When the text given represents what you will type, for example,
        the name to be given to a file before saving it, this is shown by using italics, such as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>Type <var>filename</var> in the dialogue box which appears.</blockquote>

    <p>There are several keyboard shortcuts which you can use in Fireworkz.</p>

    <p>
        If you see a key combination such as
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-X</span> or
        <span class="csg-key">Alt-space</span>, it means you should
        press the keys together in the following way:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Press and hold down the first key of the pair.</li>
        <li>Press and release the second key.</li>
        <li>Release the first key.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you see a key combination such as
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-Shift-X</span>, it means you should
        press the keys together in the following way:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Press and hold down the first key of the pair.</li>
        <li>Press and hold down the second key of the pair.</li>
        <li>Press and release the third key.</li>
        <li>Release the first and second keys.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Note that the Control key is also represented by ^ and is shown as such
        on menu short cuts. So, for example, if you see ^X you should press and hold
        down the Control key, press and release X and then release the Control
        key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some commands can be accessed directly by pressing a <em>function key</em>.
        Where this is the case the function key is referred to by the name
        shown on the key cap itself; for example function key <span class="csg-key">F1</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will see many references to the <em>caret</em>. This is the
        special pointer which shows you where you are in a document, and where any new
        text you add will be placed.
