    <h2>About Fireworkz</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz is part of the Z family of
        applications from Colton Software.
        This family includes the stand-alone applications Wordz, Resultz and Recordz.
        These stand-alone applications were developed for systems with very little memory
        in the early 1990s and are no longer available separately.
    </p>

    <h3>Wordz</h3>

    <p>
        Wordz could be used alone as a word processor to write letters,
        reports, books, invitations, shopping lists, schedules and other
        documents.
    </p>

    <h3>Resultz</h3>

    <p>
        Resultz could be used alone as a spreadsheet to perform
        calculations, analyse figures, and produce colourful charts.
    </p>

    <h3>Recordz</h3>

    <p>
        Recordz could be used alone as a database to store and manage all
        kinds of data from school and business information to personal
        details about projects and collections.
    </p>

    <h3>Fireworkz</h3>

    <p>
        Fireworkz combines the features of Wordz and Resultz enabling you to do even
        more; incorporate live results in your reports, or perform an
        automatic mail-merge to your friends or customers, for example.
    </p>

    <h3>Fireworkz Pro</h3>

    <p>
        Fireworkz Pro further combines the database features of Recordz with
        the word processing features of Wordz and
        the spreadsheet facilities of Resultz
        enabling you to create fully integrated documents.
        Fireworkz Pro is only available on RISC OS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have learned to use one of these programs you will find
        it easy to use the other members of the family, because they share
        much of the same interface and have been designed to work well
        together. This is true even if you move from RISC OS to Windows
        or vice versa; the programs have been designed to be as similar as
        possible on each platform.
    </p>

    <h2>About this Getting Started Guide</h2>

    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> includes all the information you need to
        start using Fireworkz on Windows.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A brief installation guide;</li>

        <li>Tutorials using supplied documents to show you the main features of the program;</li>

        <li>
            Hints and tips for transferring files between the RISC OS and
            Windows versions of Fireworkz.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You can find more information about the program and its features in the
        on-line help and in the <em>User Guide</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Knowledge assumed</h3>

    <p>
        This <em>Getting Started Guide</em> assumes that you are already
        reasonably familiar with the way your computer works. If you are
        new to computing, you are advised to familiarise
        yourself both with the relevant terminology and the basics of
        using your computer. You will need to know how to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Start up programs and open documents;</li>

        <li>View directories and copy files;</li>

        <li>Display menus and choose entries from them;</li>

        <li>Position and resize windows, minimise and restore windows;</li>

        <li>Scroll through documents using the scroll bars and arrows;</li>

        <li>
            Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen and to
            position the caret;
        </li>

        <li>Use the mouse buttons to click, double-click and drag objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You should understand terms such as directory, double-click
        and dialogue box.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should be able to find all this information in the system documentation
        which came with your computer. The tutorial chapters in this <em>Getting Started
        Guide</em> also provide a reminder of these skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Text in this Getting Started Guide</h3>

    <p>
        When working your way through the tutorial chapters, you will see that
        certain stylistic conventions are used to make it easier for you to see what
        you should do at each stage, what you should type in and what you should
        choose from menus.
    </p>

    <p>Certain buttons, options and commands always appear in the text in bold type. These include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Menu options. For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Choose the
            <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> command from the
            <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            Action and option buttons in dialogue boxes. For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">OK</span> button.&rsquo;
        </li>

        <li>
            Buttons on the toolbar. For example:<br />
              &lsquo;Click the
            <span class="csg-dbox-button">Style</span> button.&rsquo;
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In some places there is text for you to type in. This is always shown in a
        typewriter-style font, like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="csg-user-text">Type this text on your computer exactly as you see it.</blockquote>

    <p>
        When the text given represents what you will type, for example, the name
        to be given to a file before saving it, this is shown by using italics, such
        as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>Type <var>filename</var> in the dialogue box which appears.</blockquote>

    <p>There are several keyboard shortcuts which you can use in Fireworkz.</p>

    <p>
        If you see a key combination such as
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl-X</span> or
        <span class="csg-key">Alt-space</span>, it means you should
        press the keys together in the following way:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Press and hold down the first key of the pair.</li>

        <li>Press and release the second key.</li>

        <li>Release the first key.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Some commands can be accessed directly by pressing a <em>
            function
            key
        </em>. Where this is the case the function key is referred to by the name
        shown on the key cap itself; for example function key F1.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will see many references to the <em>caret</em>. This is the
        special pointer which shows you where you are in a document, and where any new
        text you add will be placed.
    </p>

    <h3>Conventions used</h3>

    <p>
        There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your computer,
        the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry out.
    </p>

    <h4>The mouse</h4>

    <p>
        Fireworkz on Windows uses the left button of the mouse (or its equivalent on
        any alternative pointing device which you use). When you are called to click
        on an object, this means click and release the left button of the mouse.
        For some special operations (those which are performed on RISC OS with the
        right button of the mouse) you will need to press and hold the
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key whilst
        clicking the left button of the mouse on Windows.
    </p>

    <h4>The window</h4>

    <p>
        The following terms are used for the icons and buttons with which you
        control windows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Window title bar.

            <div class="csg-li-para">This includes some helpful infomation about your Fireworkz document:</div>

            <ul>
                <li>If you have saved the document, its file name is given;</li>

                <li>
                    if the document is new, the name of the template on which it is based is given
                    (more information about use of templates is given in the <em>User Guide</em>);
                </li>

                <li>If the document has been modified since it was last saved, an asterisk will be added;</li>

                <li>
                    if you have a number of open windows belonging to the same document,
                    the title of the document will contain a numeral indicating the number of views;
                </li>

                <li>if the document is being viewed at a scale other than 100%, the scale being used in that view will be added.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Minimise button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to remove the window from the display to the Windows taskbar.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Maximise button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to make the window as large as possible on the display.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Close button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to close the window.</div>

            <div class="csg-li-para">
                When closing the last view of a modified
                Fireworkz document, you will be asked whether or not you wish to save
                the document before closing it, or simply discard your changes and
                close the window.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>Scroll bar</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="navfooter">
        <table id="navfooter" summary="Navigation footer">
            <col />
            <col />
