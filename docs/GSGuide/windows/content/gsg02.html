    <h1><span class="csg-chapter-number">2 </span>Installation</h1>

    <p>This chapter provides a brief guide to installing Fireworkz on your computer.</p>

    <h2>Installing Fireworkz on Microsoft® Windows®</h2>

    <p>
        Fireworkz may be installed on Microsoft® Windows® 11,
        Windows® 10, Windows® 8.1, Windows® 7, or Windows® XP (SP3)
    </p>

    <p>
        Fireworkz for Windows is supplied on the Colton Software web site as a
        ZIP archive file. You should download this file to your computer and then
        double-click on the ZIP archive file to expand its content.
        You will see that it contains Release Notes and a setup executable.
    </p>

    <p>
        To install Fireworkz, simply double-click the
        <code>firewrkz-<em>&lt;version&gt;</em>-windows-<em>&lt;arch&gt;</em>.exe</code> file
        and follow the instructions in the dialogue boxes that follow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that you will need to have Administrator or Power User
        permissions to install Fireworkz.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of the files that Fireworkz depends upon are stored in, or under,
        the directory that you specify on installation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <em>User Guide</em> is used as the built-in on-line help system in Fireworkz
        and is supplied as a compiled help (CHM) file for use on Windows. It is also
        available in HTML form on the Colton Software web site.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Examples files that are used in the tutorials in this
        <em>Getting Started Guide</em> are also supplied on the Colton Software web site as a
        ZIP archive file. You should download this file to your computer and then
        right-click on it to extract its content to your own user's area on your hard
        drive. This extracted content will be referred to in this guide as the
        <var>Examples</var> directory.
    </p>

    <h2>Printer drivers</h2>

    <p>
        Before you can print from Fireworkz you will need to have a printer driver
        loaded. This is a standard piece of system software which your computer uses to
        handle printing for all applications which use fonts or pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first time you use a printer driver you may need to configure it for
        your particular printer. Please pay particular attention to the page size
        settings, which often default to American paper sizes, and check that they are
        appropriate for your printer and the paper you wish to use most frequently.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the page size settings are wrong in the printer driver, in particular if
        they are too big, it is almost certain that when you print from Fireworkz, you
        will have problems with either your text being cropped (missing lines of text
        or characters from the top, bottom or sides of the page) or find that your
        printer keeps feeding through blank pages. Spending a little extra time at the
        start ensuring your printer driver is set up corrrectly may save you many
        frustrating hours of incorrect printing later on.
