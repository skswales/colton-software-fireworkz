    <h1><span class="csg-chapter-number">3 </span>The basics</h1>

    <p>This chapter will describe some of the fundamental features of Fireworkz on Windows.</p>
    <p>It includes sections on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The mouse.</li>
        <li>The document window.</li>
        <li>The menu bar.</li>
        <li>The title bar.</li>
        <li>The toolbar.</li>
        <li>The status line.</li>
        <li>The rulers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The mouse</h4>

    <p>
        Fireworkz on Windows uses the left button of the mouse (or its equivalent on any trackpad
        any alternative pointing device which you use). When you are called to click
        on an object, this means click and release the left button of the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        For some special operations you will need to press the
        <span class="csg-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Fireworkz was designed in the early 1990s,
        the right mouse button was reserved for use by OLE,
        and has since been used for context menus.
        Fireworkz does not use this mouse button.
    </p>

    <h2>The document window</h2>

    <p>
        When you use Fireworkz to create a new document or load an
        existing document, the document will appear in a window on your desktop.
        For example:
        <img src="images/theatre_13.png" alt="Example document window" style="margin-left: -10px; padding: 10px;" />
    </p>

    <p>
        The central area in white represents the paper onto which you can enter your document.
        Anything inside this area will appear when your document is printed, anything outside this area will not appear.
    </p>

    <p>The other areas of the window are explained briefly below.</p>

    <h2>The title bar</h2>

    <p>The title bar of your document window includes some helpful information about your document:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you have saved the document, its file name is shown.</li>

        <li>
            If the document is new, the name of the template on which it is based is shown.
            (Templates are used to defined how a document will be displayed -
            some templates are provided with Fireworkz and you can create others yourself.
            More information about use of templates is given in the <em>User Guide</em>.)
        </li>

        <li>If the document has been modified since it was last saved, an asterisk will be displayed.</li>

        <li>
            If you have a number of open windows belonging to the same document,
            the title of the document will contain a numeral indicating the number of views.
        </li>

        <li>
            If the document is not being viewed at full size (i.e. at a scale other than 100%),
            the scale being used in that view will be displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Minimise button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to remove the window from the display to the Windows taskbar.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Maximise / Restore Down button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to make the window as large as possible on the display,
                and then to restore its original size from maximised.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Close button.

            <div class="csg-li-para">Used to close the window.</div>

            <div class="csg-li-para">
                When closing the last view of a modified
                Fireworkz document, you will be asked whether or not you wish to save
                the document before closing it, or simply discard your changes and
                close the window.
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            Scroll bar

            <br />Used to access areas of the document not currently shown within the window.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The menu bar</h2>

    <p>
        Just below each Fireworkz document's window title bar,
        you will find the Fireworkz menu bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on a word in the Fireworkz menu, for example, <em>File</em>,
        will bring up the corresponding menu
        <span class="csg-menu">File</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several menus contain sub-menus; these are indicated by the right-pointing
        arrow alongside the option name. These sub-menus may be accessed by sliding the
        mouse pointer off the right-hand side of the menu past the right-pointing arrow;
        this will cause the sub-menu to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>Other options may be chosen from a menu by pointing at them and then clicking on them.</p>
    <p>
        Several options will execute commands that bring up dialogue boxes for
        user input; these are indicated with an ellipsis (&hellip;) alongside the option name, for example, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Print</span> option on the
        <span class="csg-menu">File</span> menu.
        The ellipsis on such menu options is omitted in this document for brevity.
    </p>

    <p>Some frequently used menu options have keyboard shortcuts which are shown alongside the option name in each menu.</p>

    <h4>Greyed out (disabled) menu options</h4>

    <p>
        From time to time, certain menu options may be greyed out (disabled)
        to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        to sort an area of your document unless you have an area selected.
        If you do not have an area selected, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        will be greyed out. As soon as you select an area, the
        <span class="csg-menu-option">Sort</span> option
        will no longer be greyed out.
    </p>

    <h2>The toolbar</h2>

    <p>
        The toolbar along the top (below the menu bar) allows you to access all the most
        commonly used commands quickly and easily by a single click on a tool button.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/toolbar/tbar.png" alt="Toolbar" style="border: 1px solid #EEE" />
    </p>

    <p>
        If you point the mouse pointer over toolbar buttons, a ToolTip message appears explaining the function of the button.
        For example, when pointing at the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Style</span> button:
    </p>
    <div class="csg-page-padding-left">
        <img src="images/toolbar/tooltip.png"/>
    </div>

    <h4>Greyed out (disabled) tool buttons</h4>
    <p>
        From time to time, certain tool buttons may be greyed out to indicate that they cannot be used at the moment.
        For example, you cannot use the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Cut</span> tool button
        to remove an area of your document uness you have an area selected.
        Therefore, if you do not have an area selected, the tool button will be greyed out.
        As soon as you select an area, the tool button will become available for use.
    </p>

    <h4>'Pressed in' tool buttons</h4>
    <p>
        Certain tool buttons may appear to be 'pressed in' or 'pushed out' to
        indicate whether or not particular options are currently selected.
        For example, if the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> tool button appears 'pressed in'
        (i.e. bold is currently selected) then any text which you type will appear in a bold font.
        If the tool button appears 'pushed out' (i.e. bold is not currently selected) then
        text will appear in normal font weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click the <span class="csg-toolbar-button">Bold</span> tool button,
        it will alternate between these two states.
    </p>

    <h2>The status line</h2>

    <p>
        The status line appears below the toolbar.
        It provides help and information about the work in progress.
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you point the mouse pointer over control areas of the
            window, such as the toolbar, a message appears explaining
            the function of the tool button.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you drag the paragraph markers in the ruler.
            the precise measurements are shown in the selected unit of measurement,
            enabling you to align text and paragraphs precisely.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you perform certain operations, such as word counts,
            the results are displayed on the status line until the mouse pointer is moved again.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Whilst you are familiarising yourself with how Fireworkz works,
        you should make use of the help provided by the status line.
    </p>

    <h2>The rulers</h2>

    <p>There are two rulers that you can choose to display:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A horizontal ruler along the top of the document.</li>
        <li>A vertical ruler down the left-hand side of the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Horizontal ruler</h3>
    <p>The horizontal ruler can be used to alter the:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paragraph margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of the first line of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Left margin - this determines the position of the left-hand edge of subsequent lines of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Right margin - this determines the position of the right-hand edge of a paragraph.</li>
        <li>Tab positions - these determined where text will appear when it is preceded by one or more Tab characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vertical ruler</h3>
    <p>The vertical ruler can be used to alter the:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Header margin - this determines the distance between the top of the paper and the printable area.</li>
        <li>Header offset - this determines the distance between the top of the printable area and the header text (if present).</li>
        <li>Footer margin - this determines the distance between the bottom of the paper and the printable area.</li>
        <li>Footer offset - this determines the distance between the bottom of the printable area and the footer text (if present).</li>
    </ul>
