Fields
Adding and removing fields
At the top of the Create database dialogue box is a box in which
you can enter the name of a new field. Below this is a list of fields
which the database structure currently contains. Initially, this list is
empty. As you add fields to it, they are added to the bottom of the
list. If you enter more fields than can be seen in the list, you can
use the scroll bar provided to move up and down the list to view
them all.

Adding a field
To add a field to your database structure:
1 Type the name of the field into the box at the top.
2 Click Add or press Return to add the field name to the bottom
of the list.
You should use a unique name for each field, this can contain a
mixture of letters and digits and can be up to 63 characters long.
Field names should not contain spaces or punctuation characters.
Note that when you view your database using a card layout, any
field titles which you choose to display will be set to the field
names.

Removing a field
To remove a field from your database structure:
1 Highlight the field by clicking on it or using the up and down
arrow keys to move the highlight bar onto it.
2 Click Remove to remove the field from the list.
