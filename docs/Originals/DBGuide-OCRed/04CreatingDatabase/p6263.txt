
Re-ordering fields
Having entered your fields, you may decide that you want to have
them in a different order. To move a field to a different position in
the list:
1 Highlight the field to be moved by clicking on it or pressing
the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard to move the
highlight bar onto it.
2 Click Up to move the field one place up the list or Down to
move the field one place down the list.
When you are happy
When you are happy with your list of fields:
. Click OK.
This will have two effects:
. A database will be created on disc. (That is why you had to
save your document to disc first - Recordz wouldn't have
known what to call the database otherwise.)
. Your document will be changed.
If you are using a sheet layout, the column headings will be
set to be field names and a row containing an empty record
will be created.
If you are using a card layout, an empty card will appear with
the field boxes labelled with the field names.

The field list box will contain the list of fields which your database

described in Chapter 11 - Editing & appending databases.
