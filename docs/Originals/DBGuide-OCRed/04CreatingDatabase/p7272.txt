Entry validation
There are also options which help to validate any data which is
entered into particular fields. For details of how these options
affect the entry of data refer to Chapter 6 - Adding & editing
records.

Compulsory fields
If a field has the Compulsory option set, then the user will not be
allowed to edit the field and leave it empty.
Note that this option is currently disabled but may be implemented
in future versions.

Checking input
For certain fields, you may wish to insist that what is entered
obeys one or more conditions. To do this you can enter a check list
or formula in the Check formula slot.
For example, in the illustration used above of foreign languages
studied by pupils, you could insist that the value entered was one
of French, German, Spanish or Italian by setting up the check list:
"French" OR "German" OR "Spanish" OR
"Italian"
Alternatively, you can check that a number, such as a distance,
was within a sensible range by setting up a check formula such as:
>1.0 AND <3.5
The expressions which may be used are described in Chapter 13 -
Expression syntax.
