
The Print dialogue box will appear. Its title bar will show you the
type of printer driver you have loaded, eg PostScript, dot matrix,
etc.:
       
1 Enter the number of copies of your document that you want to
print.
2 If you only want to print some of the pages in your document,
click the Range button. Then type in the number of the first
page and last page which you want to print.
3 Click OK.

Extra options
Several extra options are available for more advanced printing
requirements. To access them, click the Extra button in the Print
dialogue box. A larger dialogue box containing a wider range of
options will appear:

Fireworkz Pro 147

Range
The large Print dialogue box gives you greater control over the
range of pages to print. You can specify X pages (which go across
the document) and Y pages (which go down the doctnnent.) Page
number x.y means the xth page across and the yth page down.
Often you will only have one page across, in which case the first
number will always be one and so you can miss out the 1. when
specifying range information.
You can specify a list, a range or a combination of the two. For
example:

2 4 7 Prints pages 2, 4 and 7.
1 3-5 8 Prints pages 1,3,4,5 and 8.
2.1-2.7 Prints the first seven pages of the second
page across.
B1 Prints a blank page and then the first page
(for example in pamphlet printing).

Your list can be several lines long. To add more lines press Ctrl-
Return.
