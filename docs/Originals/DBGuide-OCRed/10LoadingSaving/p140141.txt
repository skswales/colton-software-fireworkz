Loading data from a spreadsheet.
If you have a Resultz spreadsheet and you want to take the data
from it and make it into a database, you can do this in two ways:
Firstly via a CSV file:
1 Highlight the data.
2 Choose the Save other option from the File menu and save
out the data to a file using the CSV option.
3 Load the CSV file into a new Recordz document as described
in the previous section.
Secondly, using the Copy and Paste buttons:
1 Create a new database with the appropriate number of fields
and display it using a sheet layout.
2 Highlight the data to be copied from the spreadsheet.
3 Click on the Copy button.
4 Place the caret in the first field of the new database.
5 Click on the Paste button.

Saving the database as a DataPower file
In order to be able to handle large databases, Recordz works
directly on the database file on disc, rather than taking a copy in
memory. Thus the database itself will automatically be updated
when you make any changes such as adding a record or editing the
contents of a field. You do not need to explicitly save the database
at any time.
However, you may wish to create smaller databases based on your
original. You can restrict the data to be exported into this new
database in two ways:
. By carrying out a search - only the subset of records will be
exported.
. By hiding fields - only data from visible fields will be
exported.
To create the new database:
1 Choose Export from the Database menu. The following
dialogue box will be displayed:
