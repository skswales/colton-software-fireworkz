
Loading an existing database
DataPower databases
If you have a database file which you have created using either
Recordz or DataPower then you can load it into a Recordz
document. To do this:
. Click on the cell where you want your first record to appear to
position the caret.
. Drag the database file and drop it into the document.
The appearance of the database will depend on the template you
have in use.
(Note that the database file referred to above is the DataPower
format file not the Recordz document file.)

Passwords
Some databases created with DataPower may have passwords
associated with them. If this is the case, the Enter Password dialogue
box will appear when you drop the database into your document.
Enter the password as requested in order to continue. Note that a
single database may have several passwords - the one you enter
will determine your access rights. For example, one password may
only allow you to view the data and a second may be required to
make changes to it.

CSV files
Recordz can also load CSV files into new, empty documents.
There are two methods of achieving this:
1 Drag the CSV file to the Recordz icon on the icon bar.
2 When the New document dialogue box appears, choose the
db_1 card, db_cards or db_sheet template.
3 Click OK.
or
1 Create a document in the usual way using the db_1 card,
db_cards or db_sheet template.
2 Save the document.
3 Drag the CSV file and drop it into the new, empty document.
When you add a CSV file two things will happen:
. The data from the CSV file will be inserted in the document
as normal - the appearance being dictated by the template in
use.
. A DataPower database file containing all the records will be
created and saved in the directory containing the current
document.
The result is the same as if you had created the database within
Recordz and typed all the information into it.
