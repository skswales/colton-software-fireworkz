Saving CSV files
Recordz also provides the option to save a subset of records and
fields separately as a CSV file. This is a standard format which is
accepted by many applications on different platforms. Thus
exporting a database as a CSV file allows you to take it across to a
PC.
To do this:
1 Choose Export from the Database menu.
2 Click on the CSV option.
3 Enter the name you wish to give to your file in the box below
the file icon.
4 Drag the file icon and drop it in a directory viewer.
Saving the Recordz document
The Recordz document holds all the information about how the
database is displayed:
. Whether a card or sheet layout is being used.
. Which fields are displayed and which are hidden.
. Whether a variable or fixed number of records is being shown
(i.e. the Auto option is set or clear).
. Which order the fields are displayed in.
. How card layouts are to appear.
