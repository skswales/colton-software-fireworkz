Database Guide 150

2 Choose the option you want. Fit one page fits all of the
document on to one page of your paper. Fit one page X does
the same but only across the paper; the document will have as
many Y pages as are needed. 100% prints a tme full size copy
of the document. Alternatively, enter the size of the document
you want by clicking the arrows or typing in a number; sizes
under 100% will reduce the size and above 100% will
increase it.
3 Click OK. The next time you print the document, it will be at
the chosen scale.

Database specific issues

Printing field names
When using a sheet layout, you can print the field names as the
column headings as follows:
1 Choose the Paper option from the Page menu.
2 Change the column margin to about 8mm.
3 Click OK.
If you click on the View control button and set the Full option in
the Display section, you will see how these appear on the page
ready to print.

Printing different layouts
By hiding fields, you can choose which pieces of information from
your database are printed. However, if you have two or more
different sets of information which you often print out, you may
find that repeated hiding and re-displaying becomes time
consuming. In this situation, you should consider creating more
docmnents which access the same database. Each document can
have a different layout defined for it. Then setting up the layout to
be printed simply becomes a matter of loading the appropriate
document file.
