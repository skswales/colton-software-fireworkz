Conditional expressions
Conditional expressions may be used to allow the resultant value
to be dependent on a decision made about the result of a boolean
expression. They can take one of two forms:
IF boolean_expression THEN expression1 ELSE expression2
boolean_expression => expression1 : expression2
In either case if the result of boolean_expression is TRUE, then
expression1 is retumed otherwise expression2 is returned.

Combining expressions
The operators AND and OR can be used as follows:
boolean_expression1 AND boolean_expression2
The result is TRUE if and only if both boolean_expression1 and
boolean_expression2 are TRUE.
boolean_expression1 OR boolean_expression2
The result is FALSE if and only if both boolean_expression1 and
boolean_expression2 are FALSE.

Use of parentheses
Parentheses may be used to alter the order in which operations are
carried out. For example:
5/(2-1) gives the result 5
whereas:
(5/2) -1 gives the result 1.5
