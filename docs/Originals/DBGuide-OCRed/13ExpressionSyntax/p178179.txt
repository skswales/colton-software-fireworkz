Database Guide 179

The contents of the file are not parsed, so they can only contain a
literal string, graphic or file. They therefore cannot contain an
integer, real, boolean or date. If an integer or real is needed from a
file, then string to numeric conversion may be obtained by the use
of the VAL function.

HOUROF
HOUROF(date/interval)
Returns an integer for the hour value of a date or interval. For
example:
HOUROF( 'Date1' )
returns the hour component of the date in the field Date1.

INCOUNT
INCOUNT(string1, string2)
Returns the number of times string2 occurs within string1 . For
example:
INCOUNT ( "MISSISSIPPI " , "S" )
returns the number 4.

INSTR
INSTR(source_txt, search_txt {, number})
Searches for search_ txt within source_txt, and returns the
number of the character in source_txt where search_txt
begins. If search_txt is not found 0 is retumed. The optional
number specifies the point in the source text where the search
should begin. For example:
INSTR("Saturday and Sunday","day")
retums the value 6 and:
INSTR("Saturday and Sunday","day",7)
returns the value 17.
