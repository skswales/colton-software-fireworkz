
Adding records
To add a new record to your database, you need to start by
identifying the database you wish to work on. To do this:
. Click on any record in the database display.
Then either:
. Click on the Add record button on the button bar.
or
- Slide off the Record option of the Database menu and choose
Add.
The new record will be added to the end of your database.

Adding records to Auto layouts
If you have set the Auto option in the Layout dialogue box so that
all the database is always visible, then an extra row will be added
to your document if necessary:
. If you are using a sheet layout, a row will always be added.
. If you are using a card layout, then the extra row will only be
added if all the columns of the bottom row were previously
full.

Adding records to non-Auto layouts
If you have chosen to clear the Auto option in order to display a
fixed number of records, then the number of rows in the display
will remain unchanged:
. If your layout is displaying any blank records (for example if
your layout is trying to display more records than your
database currently contains) then the first of these will be
replaced by the new record.

. If your layout is full, then the new record will not immediately
be visible and you will need to move to the end of the
database to see it.

Adding rows to a database
Note that you cannot use the Rows option from the Edit menu to
add records to your database.
