
Text strings
You can enter text strings, to distinguish between am and pm.
Remember to enclose the text string in double quotes.

Displaying parts of a time
You do not have to display all of the time. You may choose only
to show hours and minutes, or minutes and seconds. Build the
format you want using:
hh represents hours
mm represents minutes except that
nn is used to represent minutes when these are the first
part of the time displayed
ss represents seconds
Remember that when you are entering times, : must be used to
separate the components of the time. This ensures that the correct
time format is applied to the number.

Creating date and time formats
Each template comes with several pre-defined styles to cover
dates/times. When you enter a date, the format will be identified
and automatically set for that cell.
Later, you can use the Number section of the Style dialogue box,
to change the format if you wish. To do this click on the right
arrow at the edge of the date format definition box. A large
selection of pre-defined date and time formats will appear.
Pick one of these formats by clicking on it. It will be entered in the
date and time definition box. If it matches your requirements,
that’s all you need do; however, just like number formats, you can
edit date and time formats as long as you obey the general rules
outlined above.
