
Date and time formats
Date and time formats are managed via the Number section of the
Style editor as well. They can be entered separately, or as part of
the same combined date and time format:
You can define a style which displays times and dates in the
format you want. As with number formats, several predefined
formats are available, or you can use one of the building blocks to
design your own custom time and date formats.

12 hour and 24 hour clock
You can specify 12 hour or 24 hour clocks in your time formats. If
you enter a single time format, times will be shown as the 24 hour
clock. If you enter two formats, separated by a semi-colon (and no
spaces) the 12 hour clock will be used. So
hh:mm:ss
will produce 24 hour numbers and
hh:mm:ss;hh:mm:ss
will produce 12 hour numbers. If you create 12 hour clocks, you
should also use a text string in the format to indicate whether times
are am or pm.
