Database Guide
The width of the font will be its correct width proportional to its
height, if you leave the width set to zero. You may wish to alter
the width of the font to create a special effect:
. Setting a width smaller than the height of the type condenses
it, so that it takes up less space and appears squashed.
. Setting a width greater than the height of the type expands it,
so that it takes up more space and appears stretched.
To set the width:
1 Click on the Width button.
2 Click the arrows to increase or decrease the number shown to
reach the point size you require.

Attributes
There are five different attributes which you can apply to your
typeface singly or in combination. They are:
. Bold.
. Italic.
. Underline.
. Superscript.
. Subscript.
To add any of these:
1 Click on the on/off switch to the left of the attribute‘s icon.
The attribute button will be illuminated and appear to have been
pressed. This means that the attribute is now tumed on.
If you wanted to tum an attribute off, then:
1 Click on the on/off switch to the left of the attribute‘s icon.
2 Click on the attribute button so that it is not pressed in.
The attribute button will be illuminated and appear to have been
pushed out. This means that the attribute is now tumed off.

Colour
If you have access to a colour printer, or will be using your
document mainly on screen, you can set the colour option and use
a colour other than black for your text.
To set the text colour:
1 Click the Colour switch to on.
2 Choose the colour you want.
The colour will be shown in the bar at the bottom of the colour
section.
Note that there are several ways to choose a colour:
. Click on one of the small buttons representing the colours in
the current palette.
. Type in numerical RGB values.
. Use the arrows to enter RGB values.
