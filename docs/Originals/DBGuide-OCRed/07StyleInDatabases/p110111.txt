Changing a number format
To change the number format defined in a style:
1 Choose the style you want to edit and click on Change.
2 Display the Number section of the Changing style dialogue
box.
3 There will be a number format already shown in the box. This
is the current number format. Click on the box to the right to
display the list of other predefined number formats. If one of
these is what you want, or is closer to what you want, click on
it and it will appear in the main Number format box.
4 Edit the number format to your requirements. Type in hashes
to represent numbers, and any punctuation marks or currency
symbols you wish to appear. Remember to specify the
precision required after the decimal place.
5 Click OK. The style will be changed as specified and any
numbers entered in that style will be reformatted.

Creating your own custom number format
You may find that the alternatives within the list don’t quite match
your requirements. For example you may want to work in a
currency format other than pounds sterling.
To do this you should:
1 Display the Number section of the Style dialogue box as
described above.
2 Select the standard number fomiat which most closely relates
to what you want to create.
3 In the Number format box, edit the format by adding or
removing the necessary characters.
4 Click OK to save the new number format as part of the style
you were editing.

The auto-format system
If you create or alter styles containing number formats, the auto-
format system will recognise new numbers entered in that form.
