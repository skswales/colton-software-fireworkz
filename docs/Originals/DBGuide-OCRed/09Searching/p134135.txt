
Using subsets
When you have perfonned a search and have created a subset of
records, you can use this subset in various ways:
. When you carry out a Print, only the current subset of records
will be printed. Thus, when you have identified the set of
records you are interested in, you can print these out very
easily.
. If you choose the Export option from the Database menu,
then just the current subset of records will be exported. This
applies when exporting both Datapower and CSV format files.
Hence, this allows you to create a number of smaller
databases from the original if you wish.

Search and replace
Recordz provides a Search and replace option which can be used
on databases. This action is perfonned using an alternative Search
dialogue box. To display this:
. Choose Find from the Edit menu.
or
. Press F4.
The dialogue box will appear as follows:
    
This allows you to search for a particular string and, if you wish,
to replace it with an alternative.
If you are using a sheet layout, all fields will be searched for the
data entered. If you are using a card layout, then only the current
field will be searched.
