
For example:
< 21st Jan 1921
will match any date before 21st January 1921.
>22.03.82 AND <22.03.83
will match any date occuning between 22nd March 1982 and 22nd
March 1983.

Interval fields
<, >, <=, >=, <>
Can be used to specify intervals.

> will match any time interval longer than the given one.
<= will match any time interval shorter than or equal to the given
one.
>= will match any time interval longer than or equal to the given one.

Formula fields
The search action depends on the type of data produced by the
formula. For example, if the formula evaluates to a number, then
the field behaves like a number field when searching.

Active Queries
Each time you perform a search, the details of what you searched
for are added to an ‘active queries‘ list. This means that if you wish
to repeat a search which you performed earlier, you don't have to
re-enter all the details, you can simply select it from the list.
Similarly, if you perfonn a search and it doesn't give you the
subset of records which you required, you can amend the search
pattern. This gives you the ability to perform very sophisticated
searches.
To display the Active queries dialogue box either:
. Click Adjust on the Search button.
or
. Choose Queries from the Database menu.
or
. Press Ctrl-F4.
The dialogue box will appear as follows:

Down the left-hand side is a list of search patterns or queries. The
first is always Whole File, i.e. all the records in the database. The
others will reflect the searches you have carried out previously.
