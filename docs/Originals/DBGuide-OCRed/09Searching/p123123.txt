9 Searching
Probably the most important task which a database can perform is
to locate records of interest. Recordz allows you to perform
searches quickly and easily. It also keeps a list of the searches you
have performed so you can repeat them or gradually amend them
to isolate exactly the subset of records you require.
This chapter covers:
. Simple searches.
. Search expressions and wildcards.
. Active queries.
. Building up complex searches.
. Search and replace.
