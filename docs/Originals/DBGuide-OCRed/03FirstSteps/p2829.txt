3 Choose db_cards and the following window will appear on
your desktop:

The button bar
The button bar along the top allows you to access all the most
commonly used tools quickly and easily by a single click. (Note
than the number of buttons will be different with Fireworkz Pro
and Recordz.)

The status line
The status line appears below the button bar. It provides help and
information about the work in progress. For example:
. If you point the mouse pointer over control areas of the
window, such as the button bar, a message appears explaining
the function of the button.
. If you click in a database cell within your document, the
number of records in the database will be displayed.

Recordz menu will appear. All the database options are provided
