
Saving
Recordz works directly on the database file on disc. Thus the
changes you made to the database, such as altering its structure by
deleting a field and adding data into the records, automatically
caused the database file to be updated. You do not need to
explicitly save the database file at any time.
However, all the infomiation about how the database is displayed
is held by the Recordz document. In the previous section you
altered the display by tuming off two of the field titles and moving
data fields and titles within the card display. In order not to lose
these changes, you need to save your document. To do this:
1 Click on the Save button, or choose Save from the File
submenu or press F3.
2 Click OK to save the document using the existing name.
