
In this example, you could define the search in one go. However,
this isn't always possible and often it makes things clearer if you
search one step at a time.
So, you are going to start by looking for all your relatives. This
means people whose names are Smith:
1 Click on the menu icon next to the Name field and the
following list will appear:
is
is not
contains
does not contain
is greater than
is fess than
dent care
is empty
is not empty
expression
This specifies the search actions which you can use.
2 Choose contains and type Smith in the box to the right.
This means that you are searching for everyone whose name
field contains ‘Smith’, eg ‘Ida Smith‘ etc. Note that the case of
the letters is not important so 'Smith' will match SMITH,
smith etc.
3 Click OK and the search will be performed.
Your document will now display just the records of those people
called Smith and the status bar will say:
Record 1 in Subset - 5 records

Active queries
Each time you perform a search, the details of what you searched
for are added to an ‘active queries‘ list. This means that if you wish
to repeat a search which you performed earlier, you don't have to
re-enter all the details, you can simply select it from the list. In
addition, if you perform a search and it doesn't give you the subset
of records which you required, you can amend the search pattem
to take you nearer to the result you want.
To display the Active Queries dialogue box either:
. Click Adjust on the Search button.
or
. Choose Queries from the Database menu.
or
. Press Ctrl-F4.
The dialogue box will appear as follows:

You can see the search you perfonned in the list box.
