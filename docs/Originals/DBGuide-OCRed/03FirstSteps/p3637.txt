
These options are not appropriate for the address book database
which you are currently creating. However, it is worth knowing
about them when you are creating other databases because they
can save you a lot of time and effort.
For example, a default value is useful if a large proportion of your
records are going to have the same entry in a particular field. In
the case of names, addresses etc, you expect to have most of them
completely different. However, if you were creating a database of
your music collection then you may want to have a category type
field and have a default for this of whatever your favourite type of
music is; ‘Country & Westem', ‘Opera’, ‘Heavy Metal‘ etc.

The next few sections on adding records, entering text, moving
around the document and copying records will take you through
the steps required to create the records and enter the details into
them.

Adding records
To add a record, either:
. Click on the Add record button.
or
. Slide off the Record option of the Database menu and choose
Add.
An empty record will appear in your document.
Add further records in the same way until your document contains
six records in total. If you point within the document area of the
window, the status line will tell you how many exist at a particular
time. (The other four records will be created later by copying
existing records.)
