
Follow the steps above to enter the remaining three records. Note
that you will also have to change part of the address and telephone
number for the final record.

Numbers & dates
Numbers and dates are entered in exactly the same way as text
strings. The difference between the types of fields only affects
what you can enter in them, not how you enter it. For example, if
you tried to type a text string such as Unknown in one of the
Birthday fields, it would be rejected because the field expects a
date to be entered. When you moved out of the record, the text
would disappear. (See Chapter 14 - Date formats, for the various
date formats which you can use.)

Editing the structure
Note that the records only use 3 lines of the address, in every case
the Address4 field is empty. Therefore, you may as well delete this
field. To change the structure, choose Properties from the
Database menu and the Field properties dialogue box will appear
again.
Deleting a field
The same process can be used now to delete a field as when you
were creating the database:
1 Highlight the Address4 field.
2 Click Remove.
3 Click OK.
The field will be deleted from every record. You should be careful
when making any changes of this nature to an existing database
because the deletion cannot be undone. If you change your mind,
you have to add a new field to the structure and type the
information into each record from scratch.
