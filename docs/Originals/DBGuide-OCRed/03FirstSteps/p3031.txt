Preparing your document
The database itself is held in a separate file from the Recordz
document. Recordz creates and updates the database automatically
so you don't have to worry about it. However, in order to be able
to do this, Recordz needs to know where to create the database -
its solution is to create the database in the same directory as the
Recordz document, so the two are kept together. Therefore, the
document needs to exist on disc before the database can be
created.
Therefore, before you can create a database, you must save your
document to disc:
1 Click on the Save button or choose Save from the File menu.
A Save dialogue box will appear:

2 Enter the name you wish to give your document, for example
AddrBook in the box provided.
3 Drag the file icon and drop it in a directory viewer. Note that
the file icon will be different for Recordz and Fireworkz Pro.

Creating a new database
Each separate item of information in a database is known as a
field. You need to start by deciding what fields you want your
database to contain. For each of these fields you will need an
appropriate, unique name.
To start creating a database:
. Choose Create from the Database menu.
The following dialogue box will appear:

For this simple address book example, the fields to be used are:
Name
Address 1
Address2
Address3
Address4
Phone
Birthday

Fireworkz Pro 31
