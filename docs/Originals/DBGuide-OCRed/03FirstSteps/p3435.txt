Database Guide
Field properties
Each field can hold information of a different type. Common types
include:
. Text, for example a name or address.
. Number, for example a height or age.
. Date, for example a date of birth or manufacture.
All fields are created as text fields by default. However, in your
database, Birthday will be used to hold a date, so you should
change its type.
To change a field type:
. Choose Properties from the Database menu.
The Field properties dialogue box will appear as follows:

34 Recordz

To change the type of Birthday:
1 Highlight Birthday in the field name list by clicking on it or
pressing the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard to move
the highlight bar onto it.
2 Click on the menu icon next to the Field type box to display a
list of the types available:
Text
Number
Date
Integer
Boolean
Picture
File
Formula
Interval
3 Choose Date.
4 Click OK.
You won't notice any difference at this stage. However, this
change will be important later when you are entering data and
carrying out sorts and searches.

Other field properties
This dialogue box can also be used to add other properties to a
field as listed below:
. Default value. When a new record is created, the default value
will automatically be entered in the appropriate field.
. Value list. This provides a menu of options for the user to
choose from when entering data, in order to save typing.
. Check formula. This can be used to ensure that any values
entered in the field are appropriate ones.
