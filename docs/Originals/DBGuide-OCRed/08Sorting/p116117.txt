The dialogue box will appear as follows:

A list of all the fields in the database is presented so you can
choose which ones to sort on. Note that you can sort on fields
which are not being displayed if you wish.
The character preceding each field name determines how the
sorting process treats the data contained in the field as follows:
x Ignore.
+ Sort in ascending order (i.e. a to z for text).
- Sort in descending order (i.e. z to a for text).

Performing a sort

Sorting using a single field
To sort using a single field:
1 Highlight the field either by clicking on it or using the up and
down arrow keys to move the highlight bar onto it.
2 Click on the +/-/x button or double click on the highlighted
field to cycle through the altemative sort characters until it
reaches + or -, whichever you wish to use.
3 Click OK.
There will be a brief pause during which the cursor may change to
an hourglass and then the screen will be redrawn with the records
in their sorted order.

Sorting using multiple fields
It is possible to sort on one field, and if several records have the
same data in that field, have the order of these records defined by
looking at the contents of a second field.
For example, you can sort a database of names and addresses by
county, and if the counties match, then sort those records by town.
If you chose to perform ascending sorts in both cases on the
following records:
Rev Smith, 118 High St, Leeds, Yorkshire
Dr Jones, 93 Sea View, Grimsby, Humberside
Mrs Black, 42 Brookside, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire
Mr White, 3 The Lane, Cleethorpes, Humberside
Miss Brown, 27 River Road, Hardwick, Cambridgeshire
