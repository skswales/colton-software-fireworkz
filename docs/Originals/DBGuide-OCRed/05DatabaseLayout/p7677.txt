
The effect of templates
If you create a new database or drag an existing database file
(either a DataPower format file or a CSV file) into a document
which doesn't already contain a database, then the template which
you are using defines how the database will be displayed. The
template determines the type of display, i.e. card or sheet, number
of rows deep the display is to be and, for card layouts, the number
of columns to be used. The templates provided for Recordz have
been set up as follows:

database
. Card layout.
. 1 column.
. Variable number of rows - rows are created and deleted
automatically so that the whole database is displayed.

db_1 card
. Card layout.
. 1 column.
. 1 row.

db_cards
. Card layout.
. 1 column.
. Variable number of rows - rows are created and deleted
automatically so that the whole database is displayed.

db_sheet
. Sheet layout.
. Variable number of rows - rows are created and deleted
automatically so that the whole database is displayed.

Changing the layout
Whichever layout you start with, you are free to change it at any
time by using the Layout dialogue box To display this, either:
. Click on the Layout button on the button bar.
or
. Choose Layout from the Database menu.
The Layout dialogue box will appear, for example:

If this is the first time you have used the Layout dialogue box, the
current settings will be taken from the template which you are
using.
