
Display formats: cards v sheets
There are two fundamentally different ways in which you can
display your records; either using a card layout or a sheet layout.

Card layouts
With a card layout, each record occupies a single cell. The depth
of the cell is determined initially by the number of fields being
displayed. (Note that a card cannot span more than one page,
either horizontally or vertically, therefore there is a limit on the
number and size of fields which can be displayed using a card
layout.) You can choose the number of cards to be placed side by
side i.e. the number of columns to be used and the number of cards
to be displayed vertically, i.e. the number of rows to be used. For
example:

This shows a card display which is two columns wide and three
rows deep. Thus a total of six cards are visible. (Note that the
Scale option from the Page menu has been used to fit the two
columns on a single page.)

Sheet layouts
With a sheet layout, each record occupies a single row but
multiple columns. The number of columns is determined by the
number of fields being displayed. For example:

This shows six records from a database, each of which contains
five fields. Thus the database is occupying six rows by five
columns. Note that the Column border and Row border displays
have been turned on, using the View Control button, to show that
the columns are labelled with the Field names.
