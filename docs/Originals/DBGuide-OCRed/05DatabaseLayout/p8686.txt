
Grid positions
When moving or resizing the title or field boxes, they are snapped
to a grid defined by the ruler markings as follows:
. Whilst resizing, positions are snapped to the finer grid.
. Whilst moving, positions are snapped to the coarse grid,
unless the Ctrl key is held down, in which case they are
snapped to the finer grid.
For example, for the 0.1 cm ruler, the coarse grid divisions occur
at 0.5 cm intervals and the fine grid divisions at 0.1 cm intervals.
Therefore, the box sizes can be changed in steps of 0.1 cm and the
box positions can be changed in steps of either 0.5 cm (by default)
or 0.1 cm (if the Ctrl key is held down).
To change the ruler markings, choose Ruler from the Extra menu
and select a measurement from the list presented.

Styles
Text within a particular field can be re-styled independently of the
other fields. This allows fields to be justified differently, contain
different sized text etc. For details on how to achieve this, see
Chapter 7 - The Style editor in databases.
Similarly, the appearance of the border surrounding a field box can
be altered using the Style editor. This allows you to change its
colour and line style, or remove it altogether if you wish.

Multiple layouts
A database file can be accessed by more than one document file.
This allows you to have a number of different documents, each
displaying information from a database using a different layout.
Hence if there are two or more different ways in which you
commonly want to view your data, you don't have to keep using p
the Layout dialogue box to swap between them, you can simply
set up multiple documents, define the layout for each and then
load the appropriate one.
