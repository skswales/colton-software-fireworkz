Editing card layouts
The Layout dialogue box described earlier in this chapter allows
you to specify which fields and field titles to have displayed.
When you have made your selection and clicked on OK to
confirm it, each record will appear in a default card format. For
example:

Note the following features:
. The left-hand edges of all the field boxes are vertically
aligned.
. Only a fixed number of characters are displayed for each of
the field names so the second field name which, in this
example, should be Postal address is not fully visible.
. The sizes of the field boxes are set to default values,
regardless of their contents.
The position and size of the titles or field boxes can be changed.
You can make the changes to any of the cards being displayed and
the remainder will be updated simultaneously.

Changing the position
To change the position of a title or field box:
1 Double click on the object you wish alter within any of the
cards being displayed. A red selection box will appear around
the object. For example:
2 Move the pointer inside the selection box.
3 Hold the Select button down and drag the object to where you
want it to be.
4 Release the mouse button and the box will appear at its new
position in all the cards.

Changing the size
To change the size of a title or field box:
1 Double click on the object you wish alter within any of the
cards being displayed so that the red selection box appears.
2 Point at one of the selection handles.
3 Hold the Select button down and drag the object to its new
size.
4 Release the mouse button and the box will appear at its new
size and shape in all the cards.
