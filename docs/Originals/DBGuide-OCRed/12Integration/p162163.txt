Database functions
Fireworkz Pro provides a range of powerful tools specifically for
analysing the data within spreadsheets. These can perform a
function on any fields which meet a specified condition. For
example:
DCOUNTA(?height,?height>100)
will count all the records which have a value in their height field
which is greater than 100.
DAVG(?height,?height<>0)
will look at all the records which have a non-zero value in their
height field and find the average height of them.
The functions are listed in the Database functions section of the
Spreadsheet Guide.

Mail merges
The mail shots facility creates personalised mailings from a
combination of two files. One should be a text document which
contains references to the fields or columns in the address list. The
other should be a document containing a list of names and
addresses.
With Fireworkz or Wordz, the address list could be:
. A list held in a Fireworkz or Resultz worksheet.
. A list stored in CSV format.
With Fireworkz Pro you can also use:
. A database held in a Fireworkz Pro worksheet.
. A database held in a Recordz document using a sheet layout.
The details of how to set up the mail shot are covered in the
Advanced features chapter of the User Guide. The only difference
is that to print the mail shot you now:
. Click on the Mailshot button in the Print dialogue box.
The Print option has been removed from the Mailshot menu.
