Database Guide 158
For fields to be considered to be the same, they must have:
' The same name.
~ The same type.
So, if two databases each contain a field of the same name but of a
different type, then the resulting database will contain two fields of
that name. For example:
Database A Database B
Fields: Fields:
Name Name
Address Address
Phone (Text) Phone (Number)
Database C
Fields:
Name
Address
Phone (Text)
Phone (Number)
Appending database B to database will produce database C which
has two Phone fields. This is unlikely to be what you were
intending. So, if this happens you should change one of the
database structures and try again.
Note that in certain circumstances it may not be possible for
Recordz to carry out the append. If this happens then an error
message will be displayed and no changes will take place.
