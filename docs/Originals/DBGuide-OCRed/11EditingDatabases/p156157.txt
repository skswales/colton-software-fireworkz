Appending databases
If you have a database currently being displayed in your
document, you can append another one to it as follows:
1 Click within your database to identify it.
2 Drag the second database (ie the appropriate DataPower
format file) from a directory viewer and drop it into your
document.
All the records from the second database will be added to the
records of the first database:
. If the first database was unsorted, the extra records will be
added to the end.
. If the first database was sorted, the extra records will be
placed in their correctly sorted positions.

Appending a database containing different fields
You can append one database to another even if they haven't got
the same structure. For example, consider the databases shown
below:
Database A Database B Database C
Fields: Fields: Fields:
Name Name Name
Address Address Address
Phone Birthday Phone
Birthday

If you append database B to database A you will obtain database
C. All of the records which came from database A will have the
Birthday field empty and all of the records which came from
database B will have the Phone field empty.
