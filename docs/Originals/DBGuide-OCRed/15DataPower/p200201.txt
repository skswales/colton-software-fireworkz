Layouts
If you have a DataPower database, you can use this with both
DataPower and Recordz without losing the layout information
created by either.
The DataPower file contains layout information which is required
by the DataPower application to determine how the database will
appear. Recordz does not use this layout information. It stores its
layout information inside the separate Recordz document file(s).
However, Recordz ensures that the DataPower layout information
within the database file is preserved.
This means that if one user wishes to access a database using
Recordz and another using DataPower then they can do so without
affecting each others layout.

Multi-user use
lt is possible to use Fireworkz Pro as a client of a DataPower
scrver on a networked system and thus give multi-user access to
the same database.
To do this:
1 Point at the Fireworkz Pro icon on the icon bar, click the
menu button and select the Choices option. The Choices
dialogue box will appear.
2 Set the DataPower client option by clicking on it.
3 Click OK.
Stand-alone users should ignore this option.
