  <h1><a name="splitting_the_view" id="splitting_the_view"></a>Splitting the view</h1>

  <p>Sometimes you may find it useful to display two separate parts of a document at once, within the same window. This is useful if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You need to cut and paste items from one end of a long document to the other.</li>

    <li>You want to use a row or column for titles or categories at the top or left of the screen, in a spreadsheet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>To set up split views:</h2>

  <p>Display the <span class="csguide-dbox">View control</span> dialogue box.</p>

  <p>Click on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Vertical split</span> button to divide the window vertically. You might want to do this if you were comparing one part of your document with another or cutting and pasting.</p>

  <p>Click on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Horizontal split</span> button to divide the window horizontally. You might want to do this is you have a very wide table.</p>

  <p>Click on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> button in the dialogue box. The screen will be displayed with your chosen view.</p>

  <p>Use the scroll bars and arrows for each view to move to the parts of the document you want to display. You can also resize each half of the window independently using the Adjust size icon.</p>

  <h2>Splitting the view on screen (Windows)</h2>

  <p>You can split the screen by selecting and dragging the split pointer. Simply:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Point to the area just above the top of the vertical scroll bar or to the left of the horizontal scroll bar. You will see the pointer change into a bar with an arrow pointing from either side.</li>

    <li>Drag the pointer to the place in the window where you want the split to be.</li>

    <li>You can point to the split line and move it, and independently scroll the two portions of the window.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To close the split, point to it and drag it back up to the edge of the top or leftmost scroll bar. The single editing window will be restored.</p>
