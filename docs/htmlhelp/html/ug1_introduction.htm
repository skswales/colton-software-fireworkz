  <h2>About Fireworkz</h2>

  <p>Fireworkz is part of the Z family of applications from Colton Software.
    It is compatible with documents created in other members of this family such as
    Fireworkz Pro (as Fireworkz with additional database facilities) and the earlier
    Wordz (a stand-alone word processing application) and
    Resultz (a stand-alone spreadsheet application).</p>

  <p>You can use Fireworkz as a word processor to write letters,
    reports, books, invitations, shopping lists, schedules and other
    documents.</p>

  <p>You can use Fireworkz as a spreadsheet to perform
    calculations, analyse figures, and produce colourful charts.</p>

  <p>Fireworkz combines these two functions enabling
    you to do even more
    that you could with separate word processing and spreadsheet applications -
    incorporate live results in your reports, or
    automatic mail-merge to your friends or customers, for example.</p>

  <p>Once you have learned how to use Fireworkz on one platform,
    RISC&nbsp;OS for instance, you should find it easy to use on any other platform,
    such as Windows, as it has been designed to be as similar as possible on each platform.</p>

  <h2>About this Guide</h2>

  <h3>What you need to use Fireworkz</h3>

  <p>This Guide assumes that you are already reasonably familiar
    with the way your computer works. If you are new to computing,
    or to RISC&nbsp;OS or Windows, you are advised to familiarise yourself
    both with the relevant terminology and the basics of using your
    computer. You will need to know how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start programs and open documents;</li>

    <li>Access discs, view directories, and copy files;</li>

    <li>Display menus and choose entries from them;</li>

    <li>Position windows on screen and change their size using the
      back icon, toggle size icon, adjust size icon and the title bar (in
      RISC&nbsp;OS); position and resize windows, use Windows Explorer,
      minimise and restore windows (Windows);</li>

    <li>Scroll through documents using the scroll bars and arrows;</li>

    <li>Use the mouse to move the pointer around the screen and to
      display and position the caret, and how to use the mouse
      buttons to click, double-click, and drag objects.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You should also understand terms such as directory, double-click,
    and dialogue box.</p>

  <p>You will find all this information in the RISC&nbsp;OS User Guide
    and Windows documentation provided with your computer.
    The tutorial chapters in the <i>Getting Started guide</i> also
    provide a reminder of these skills.</p>

  <p>Technical terms used in this guide are explained when they
    first appear, and in the <a href="us98_glossary.htm">Glossary</a> at the end. However, you should
    also refer to the documenation which came with your computer for
    the basic vocabulary used to describe parts of your computer and
    the tasks you can do with it.</p>

  <h3>What you will learn from this Guide</h3>

  <p>This Guide provides a complete reference for all the menu
    commands and on-screen buttons in
    Fireworkz, so that if you have any questions while you are doing
    your own work you will quickly be able to find the answer.</p>

  <p>Separate sections cover each subject in detail.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You will find that some topics need to be covered separately for
      RISC&nbsp;OS and Windows versions of
      Fireworkz. Where this happends, a clearly labelled subsection
      describes the relevant information for each type of computer.<br/><br/>
      This only usually happens where there is a specific
      difference in the way the computers and operating systems
      require the program to operate.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RISC&nbsp;OS conventions used in this Guide</h3>

  <p>There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your
    computer, the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry
    out.</p>

  <h4>The mouse</h4>

  <p>The three buttons on your mouse each perform separate
    functions, and their names reflect this. Their names are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Left mouse button: <b>Select</b></li>
    <li>Middle mouse button: <b>Menu</b></li>
    <li>Right mouse button: <b>Adjust</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Many actions using the mouse are performed by <b>clicking</b> or
    <b>double-clicking</b> an object. To do this, position the pointer over
    the required object (e.g. the Fireworkz application icon) and press and
    release the left-hand, <b>Select</b> button once or twice respectively.</p>

  <p>Pressing the middle, <b>Menu</b> button with the pointer inside a
    Fireworkz window displays the main menu, from which you may
    choose an option by pointing at it and clicking with the <b>Select</b>
    button.</p>

  <p>The right-hand, <b>Adjust</b> button can be used to access some
    short-cuts and more sophisticated functions.</p>

  <h3>Windows conventions used in this Guide</h3>

  <p>There are set terms used to describe many of the parts of your
    computer, the objects displayed on screen and tasks you will carry
    out.</p>

  <h4>The mouse</h4>

  <p>Fireworkz uses the left button of the Windows mouse (or its equivalents on any trackball or any alternative pointing device which you use).
    When Fireworkz was designed, the right-hand mouse button was reserved for use by OLE, and has since been used for context menus, so Fireworkz does not use this button.
    For some special operations you will need to press the <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button.</p>
