  <h1><a name="number_formats" id="number_formats"></a>Number formats</h1>

  <p>Fireworkz contains a number of standard number formats which are built in and easily applied to any numbers in spreadsheets. Because number formats are an aspect of style, number formats are manipulated through the style editor.</p>

  <p>These formats are stored in the Number section of the style editor. You can access them to create the styles you need which can be stored in the style list. You can also create your own completely custom number formats.</p>

  <p>For example, the list contains a ready-made option for producing continental format numbers (where the decimal point is represented by a comma, and a full stop is used as a thousands separator). By adding the character F after the number as part of the format, your numbers will automatically appear as French francs.</p>

  <p>As well as adding characters to show currency, you can also use the style system to specify the precision to which numbers are shown. When you do this, the number displayed on screen is rounded to the number of decimal places which you requested, even though Fireworkz keeps the full number and uses it internally for calculations.</p>
