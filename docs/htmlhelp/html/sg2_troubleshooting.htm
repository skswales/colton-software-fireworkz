  <p>There are some common problems to avoid when writing formulae and building up your worksheet:</p>

  <h2>Punctuation</h2>

  <p>Using the wrong punctuation, or missing out significant symbols, can mean that your formula will not work.</p>

  <p>The most important things to watch out for are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Commas must separate all the parameters of a formula. For example, in the formula</li>

    <p>IF(A1=2, SUM(B1:B20), SUM(C1:C20))</p>

    <p>the commas tell Fireworkz that the first section is the condition which must be tested; the second is the action to take if the condition is true, and the third is the action to take if the condition is false.</p>

    <li>Missing brackets mean that Fireworkz cannot calculate the formula because it does not know that it is complete. If you omit brackets you will usually see an error message on the status line.</li>

    <li>If you omit or mismatch brackets from a complex formula it may mean that the formula is calculated differently from the way you intended and returns an incorrect result.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Order of parameters</h2>

  <p>It is vital for many functions that parameters are supplied in the correct order. Information about the correct parameters is given in the function when it is pasted from the function selector, and further information appears in the status line.</p>

  <h2>Cell types</h2>

  <p>If you attempt to perform a numerical calculation on text cells, you will not get a result but instead see an error message. This will probably be String not expected. If you have put numbers into text cells you can convert them into number cells either by editing them individually or by selecting them and using <b>Make number</b> from the <b>Make</b> submenu on the <b>Edit</b> menu.</p>

  <h2>Circular references</h2>

  <p>A circular reference is formed when a formula attempts to operate on the contents of a cell which is itself dependent on the results of the same formula. For example, cell B5 contains the formula SUM(B1:B4) and B1 contains the cell reference B5. This creates an insoluble problem; the formula cannot calculate because its data is dependent on its result.</p>

  <p>If you create a circular reference, you will see the word <code>Error</code> in the cells which refer to each other, and a warning message in the status line. You will then need to go to the cells and see what the problem is, and solve it.</p>
