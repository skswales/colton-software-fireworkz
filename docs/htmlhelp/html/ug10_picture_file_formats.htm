  <h1><a name="picture_file_formats" id="picture_file_formats"></a>Picture file formats</h1>

  <p>Pictures in a variety of formats can be added to your documents. Fireworkz can also create pictures in the form of <a href="sg4_charts.htm">charts</a>. These can be saved as RISC&nbsp;OS Draw files.</p>

  <p>Fireworkz supports the following picture formats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>JPEG/JFIF (.JPG,.JPEG)</li>

    <li>RISC&nbsp;OS Draw (.AFF)</li>

    <li>RISC&nbsp;OS sprite (.FF9)</li>

    <li>Windows bitmap (.BMP)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Fireworkz on RISC&nbsp;OS supports the import of other picture formats using ChangeFSI (if it is available).</p>

  <p>Pictures in these formats can be added to a document or transferred between RISC&nbsp;OS and Windows computers as files embedded in or referenced by a Fireworkz document.</p>

  <p>Windows uses the file extensions .AFF for RISC&nbsp;OS Draw files and .FF9 for RISC&nbsp;OS sprites. Adding these extensions to file names will make it easier for the Windows computer to recognise files as suitable graphics and insert them into your document. You should make sure that your sprites and Draw files do not have any other extension added to their name as they will then not be correctly read by Fireworkz.</p>

  <p>You can use the (now free) OakDraw package to create and edit RISC&nbsp;OS Draw files on Windows.</p>
