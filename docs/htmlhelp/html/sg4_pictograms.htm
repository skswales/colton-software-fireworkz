  <h1><a name="pictograms" id="pictograms"></a>Pictograms</h1>

  <p>The buttons in the third row produce pictograms, in which the bars of the chart are made up out of pictures. Any sprite file or draw file can be used as the basis of a pictogram.</p>

  <p>The first button creates a pictogram where the original image is stacked up as many times as necessary to create the correct height of bar. The number of pictures that appear is dependent on the tick positions on the y-axis. If the number is between two tick positions, it is always rounded down. You cannot have half a penguin</p>

  <p>The second button stretches the image to create a bar of the correct height.</p>

  <p>The following tips apply for successful use of pictograms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use only one data series to reduce clutter</li>

    <li>Don't have too many points on it</li>

    <li>Use simple (fast-drawing), colourful, meaningful pictures for best effect, such as company logos.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Adding your own pictures to pictograms</h2>

  <p>To add your own pictures to a pictogram:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select the data series to which you want to add the picture by clicking the left mouse button on it. If you want to add the picture to a single data point, click Ctrl-left mouse button on it. There will normally be only one data series, so you normally click Ctrl-left mouse button to select an element.</li>

    <li>Drag a suitable sprite, .bmp or Draw file into the chart window.</li>

    <li>The chart will be redrawn using your chosen picture.</li>
  </ol>
