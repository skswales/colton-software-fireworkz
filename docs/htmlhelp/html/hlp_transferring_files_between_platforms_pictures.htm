  <h1><a name="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures" id="transferring_files_between_platforms_pictures"></a>Pictures and charts (transferring)</h1>

  <p>Charts and pictures which are embedded within RISC&nbsp;OS documents will be transferred along with the text and the rest of the document. Fireworkz for Windows will interpret and display embedded sprite and draw files, and also more complex pictures such as pictogram charts which are effectively a draw file containing embedded sprites or further draw files.</p>

  <p>Referenced pictures will usually be transferred or translated. However, you must first make sure that the file names of embedded pictures can be understood by DOS. For example, they should be no more than eight characters. You will also need to make sure that in both the original and the copy that all the files are in the same directory: this makes it much easier for Fireworkz to find the files.</p>
