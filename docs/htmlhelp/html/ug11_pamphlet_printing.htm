  <p>The pamphlet printing option enables you to print documents which will be folded and stapled to produce an A5 pamphlet. For example in an eight page document page one will be printed next to page eight, page two next to page seven, and so on.</p>

  <p>To switch on pamphlet printing, click on the Pamphlet button. You will see that the Two up option has been switched on as well, and that the range list box contains a list of pages showing you the pairs that will appear on each page. B means a blank page.</p>

  <p>Pamphlet printing assumes that you have a duplex printer, i.e. one which automatically feeds the pages back through to print on the reverse side. If this is not the case:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Delete every alternate line (representing a pair of pages) from the Range list box, by selecting the entries and pressing Delete.</li>

    <li>Print the remaining pages.</li>

    <li>Reload the paper into the printer the correct way round.</li>

    <li>Choose Pamphlet printing again and delete the pages you have already printed.</li>

    <li>If necessary, switch on Reverse printing as well. The aim is to get page two to appear on the back of page one. You may need to experiment to get your pages in the right order and the correct orientation.</li>
  </ol>
