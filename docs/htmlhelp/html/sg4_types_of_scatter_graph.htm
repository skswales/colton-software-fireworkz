  <h1><a name="types_of_scatter_graph" id="types_of_scatter_graph"></a>Types of scatter graph</h1>

  <p>There are nine types of scatter graph, based on three types of graph to which vertical error bars or vertical and horizontal error bars can be added.</p>

  <p>Two sets of data are required for each point, to provide the x and y coordinates respectively. Vertical error bars are taken from the third set of data, and horizontal error bars from the fourth.</p>

  <h2>Line</h2>

  <p>A line is drawn from point to point. Note that Fireworkz does not automatically sort data for charts, and you should therefore sort the x coordinates in ascending order or your line could travel both forwards and backwards across the chart.</p>

  <h2>Point</h2>

  <p>Each data point is represented by a blob at its x,y coordinate.</p>

  <h2>Line and point</h2>

  <p>Each data point is represented by a blob, and a line is drawn between the data points.</p>
