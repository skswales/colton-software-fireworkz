  <h1><a name="tabs" id="tabs"></a>Tabs</h1>

  <p>Tabs, like margins, can be set using either the style editor (Ruler section) or the ruler. It is easier to set tabs using the tab icons on the toolbar and the ruler, but you may want to edit tab settings in the Style editor for precision.</p>

  <a name="about" id="about"></a>
  <h2>About tabs</h2>

  <p>Four types of tab marker are available in Fireworkz:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Left</li>
    <li>Centre</li>
    <li>Right</li>
    <li>Decimal</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Their names relate to the way tabbed text is formatted by them:</p>

  <p>The default setting for tabs in Fireworkz letter documents is that left tab markers are positioned every 2cm along the ruler. These tabs can be repositioned by dragging; they will also move if the left margin is moved, but they will always stay at the same place in relation to the left margin when this happens.</p>

  <p>In the <span class="csguide-dbox">Style</span> dialogue box, tab markers are presented as a list, and their type and position on the ruler is shown.</p>

  <a name="adding" id="adding"></a>
  <h2>Adding tabs with the ruler</h2>

  <p>To add a tab to a style using the ruler:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Place the caret in an area of text which uses the style. If the area has more than one style set, the style in which tabs are set will be the one changed. If you select an area of text, any changes you make will only be applied to that area.</li>

    <li>Click on the type of tab marker you want in the tab well in the toolbar. The selected type of tab will appear in blue in the tab well.</li>

    <li>Point at the ruler and click the mouse in the place where you want the tab.</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="repositioning" id="repositioning"></a>
  <h2>Repositioning tabs</h2>

  <p>To reposition tabs:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Place the caret in an area of text using the style you want to change.</li>

    <li>Point at the tab you want to move.</li>

    <li>When the pointer turns into a two way arrow, press and hold down the left mouse button and drag the tab marker to the new position. The status line will help you to position tabs accurately. All the tabs to the right will move by the same amount. If you only want to move one tab, without changing those to the right, press the <span class="csguide-key">Ctrl</span> key and the left mouse button.</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="removing" id="removing"></a>
  <h2>Removing tabs</h2>

  <p>To remove tab markers point at them in the ruler and double-click with the left mouse button.</p>

  <a name="editing" id="editing"></a>
  <h2>Adding and editing tabs in the style editor</h2>

  <p>It is much easier to set tabs directly on the page, and by ensuring that you have placed the caret in an area of text to which a style has been applied, your changes will be saved as part of the style. However, you may prefer to set tabs within the style editor itself. To do this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Move to the Tabs section of the Ruler section of the style editor for the style to which you wish to add tabs.</li>

    <li>Type in the values for the tabs you want in the current ruler unit of measurement. Type in the number for the tabs position, and a letter to show what type of tab is required:</li>

    <table>
      <tr>
	    <td>L</td>
	    <td>Left</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	    <td>C</td>
	    <td>Centre</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	    <td>R</td>
	    <td>Right</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	    <td>D</td>
	    <td>Decimal</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <li>Click <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span> or move to another part of the style editor.</li>
  </ol>
