  <h1><a name="changing_column_width" id="changing_column_width"></a>Changing column width</h1>

  <p>Tables are usually created with all their columns of equal width. However, you may need one or more columns to be wider than the others. For example, if you made a table to display students marks in a series of tests, you would need a wide column for their names and narrower columns for the marks.</p>

  <p>To change column width:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Place the caret in the column you want to change. If you want to change more than one column, select all the columns you want to change by putting the caret in the upper leftmost cell and dragging down to the lower rightmost.</li>

    <li>Point at the column width marker in the ruler.</li>

    <li>When the pointer turns into two vertical lines with arrows pointing out from them, press the Select button and drag this new pointer along to the place where you want the column to end. The status line will give you precise information about the measurement.</li>

    <li>The table will now appear with the extended or shrunken column you have altered.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can change the width of part of a column, by selecting only those cells whose width you want to change and following the process outlined above.</p>
