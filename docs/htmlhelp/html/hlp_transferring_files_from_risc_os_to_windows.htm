  <p>The process of transferring files to Windows is quite simple. The work needs to be done at the RISC&nbsp;OS end, so if you are going to be sent files and do not have access to an RISC&nbsp;OS computer, make sure that the person sending the files has a copy of this chapter and follows the instructions.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Check the document for any of the pitfalls outlined above.</li>

    <li>Either place a DOS format floppy in your floppy drive, or mount a PC or other server disc across your network.</li>

    <li>Copy the files on to the disc.</li>

    <li>You will need to rename the file and change its type. Select the file in the filer window and press the menu button. Choose Rename file from the menu which appears.</li>

    <li>Add the extension /FWK, for example FILENAME/FWK. This will be interpreted by Windows as FILENAME.FWK.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can now take the file to a Windows computer.</p>
