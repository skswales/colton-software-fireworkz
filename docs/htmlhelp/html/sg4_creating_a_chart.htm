  <p>The first step in creating a chart is to enter or compute your data within a worksheet.</p>

  <h2>Preparing your data</h2>

  <p>There are ways to organise your data to make it easier to build a chart.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Charts are initially constructed out of contiguous ranges of cells. So it is easier if your data can be selected in this way. Once a chart has been created, extra data can be added to it from other parts of the worksheet.</li>

    <li>Charts use row and column headings which have been entered in text cells as labels for the legend and data series within the chart. If your data is clearly labelled on the worksheet it will make it much easier to set up your chart and understand it on the page.</li>

    <li>Most of the chart dialogue boxes enable you to specify that the first row or column in the range is used as the legend or as labels rather than as data. Usually, Fireworkz will detect text and treat it as a label automatically, but if you want numeric labels for data in your chart you will need to specify this.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Making the chart</h2>

  <p>Follow this process to make your chart:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select the range of data you want to include in the chart, and click on the <span class="csguide-toolbar-button">Chart</span> button. The data must be in number cells.</li>

    <li>The chart menu will appear, from which you should choose the type of chart you want.</li>

    <li>A <a href="ug2_dialogue_boxes.htm">dialogue box</a> for that type of chart will appear. Choose the type you want by clicking on the icons, and enter any other details necessary in the dialogue box.</li>

    <li>Click <span class="csguide-dbox-button">OK</span>. Your chart will be generated and appear on the worksheet in its own frame, just beneath the data on which it was based. In some cases (such as low-resolution screen modes) this may be off the screen.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once you have made your chart, you can edit and customise it in certain ways. See:</p>
