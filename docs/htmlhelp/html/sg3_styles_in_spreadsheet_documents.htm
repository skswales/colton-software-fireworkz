  <h1><a name="styles_in_spreadsheet_documents" id="styles_in_spreadsheet_documents"></a>Styles in spreadsheet documents</h1>

  <p>You will be familiar with the way in which Fireworkz uses styles to make text and numbers appear at a particular size, or in a particular font or style.</p>

  <p>The style system is also used to apply formatting information to numbers, such as whether they are shown as currency, in continental format, as a percentage or a scientific or engineering format.</p>

  <p>The style editor is also used to define how the current cell is shown, and can be used to add borders to cells.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, you should define styles containing number formatting information independently of styles containing font or paragraph layout information, to increase the flexibility with which styles can be used. You can apply as many styles as necessary to a cell or to text within a cell.</p>

  <h2>Predefined styles</h2>

  <p>The Sheet template supplied with Fireworkz contains several predefined number formats built in. These are automatically available in any document based on the Sheet template, simply by choosing them from the style list and applying them to selected cells.</p>
