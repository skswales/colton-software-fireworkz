  <h1><a name="find_and_replace" id="find_and_replace"></a>Find and replace</h1>

  <p>Find and replace enables you to replace all occurrences of a word in a document with a different word.</p>

  <p>To replace a word:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose <span class="csguide-menu-option">Find</span> from the <span class="csguide-menu">Edit</span> menu, or press function key <span class="csguide-key">F4</span>.</li>

    <li>The <span class="csguide-dbox">Find and replace</span> dialogue box is displayed.</li>

    <li>Type the word you want to find into the top box. If you have a selection less than a paragraph it will appear in the box automatically.</li>

    <li>Choose the options you want in the dialogue box, if you want to alter the default settings, eg to search for parts of words.</li>

    <li>Click on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace</span> button, if you want to replace the word you are looking for. Type the word you want to replace it with into the bottom box. Select the <span class="csguide-option">Copy capitals</span> option if you want to replace like with like, so that occurrences of the word at the start of sentences will keep their initial capitalisation.</li>

    <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">From top</span> or <span class="csguide-dbox-button">From caret</span> button. The next occurrence of the word will be found after the chosen point and, if you selected the <span class="csguide-option">Replace with</span> option, a further dialogue box will appear.</li>

    <li>Choose one of the options to continue.<ul>
	<li><span class="csguide-dbox-button">Next</span> skips this occurrence of the word and looks for the next one;</li>
	<li><span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace</span> replaces the current instance of the word and looks for the next one;</li>
	<li><span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace all</span> finds and replaces all occurrences of the word in the document or selected part of it.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you are simply finding a word, rather than replacing it, you will see the word highlighted in the text when it is found. To continue looking for further occurrences of the word, press function key <span class="csguide-key">F4</span>.</p>

  <p>To hunt for several occurrences of a word even if you don't actually want to replace it, select the <span class="csguide-option">Replace with</span> option. This will display the <span class="csguide-dbox">Found</span> dialogue box whenever the word is found, enabling you to hunt for the next occurrence. Remember to press <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Next</span> rather than <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace</span>, unless you type the word in as the word to replace as well as the word to find.</p>

  <a name="special" id="special"></a>
  <h2>Finding special characters</h2>

  <p>There are some special characters which you can search for with Find and Replace.</p>

  <p><code>^T</code> will find any tabs in a document.</p>

  <p><code>^R</code> will find any internal returns (line breaks) within paragraphs.</p>

  <p><code>^^<code> will find the <code>^<code> character.</p>

  <p>You can use these character combinations in both the Find and Replace fields of the dialogue box.</p>
