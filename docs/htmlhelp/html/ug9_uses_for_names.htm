  <h1><a name="uses_for_names" id="uses_for_names"></a>Uses for names</h1>

  <p>You can use names in some quite sophisticated ways to provide a range of additional features to your documents. Remember that a name does not have to contain a number or formula; it can contain any kind of information, entered as a string or a date.</p>

  <h2>Names as numerical variables</h2>

  <p>You can use names to enter numerical variables in formulae. For example, you could create a name vat_rate, to enter the value 0.175 in any formula or cell. If the vat rate was decreased, you could then change the definition of the name, and all your formulae using it would be updated.</p>

  <h2>Names as text variables</h2>

  <p>Names can be used to insert variables in text. For example, you could be writing about a product with a code name. By defining a name with the products code name, you can easily change it in all documents containing the name by changing the value of the name.</p>

  <p>To do this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the Function selector and choose <b>Names</b>.</li>

    <li>Choose <b>New</b> in the dialogue box which appears.</li>

    <li>Enter a name for the new name.</li>

    <li>Enter the current value. You must enter it as a string, which means enclosing the text in double quotes like this:<br/>
    &quot;Big bang plus&quot;</li>

    <li>You can now use the name throughout your documents by using <b>Name</b> from the <b>Inserts</b> menu.</li>
  </ol>
