  <h1><a name="checking_spellings" id="checking_spellings"></a>Checking spellings</h1>

  <p>There are three options for checking your spelling in Fireworkz documents. You may either check as you type, check your whole document in one go when you have finished editing, or select part of your document and check that.</p>

  <a name="asyoutype" id="asyoutype"></a>
  <h2>Check as you type</h2>

  <p>To check your spelling as you type, you will need to select the <span class="csguide-option">Auto check</span> option in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Choices</span> dialogue box, accessed through the icon bar (RISC&nbsp;OS) or <span class="csguide-menu">File</span> (Windows) menu.</p>

  <p>As you type, each word is checked against the built-in dictionary. When you make a spelling mistake or enter a word which the dictionary does not know your computer will alert you to the mistake by beeping.</p>

  <p>You can either:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ignore the beep and continue.</li>

    <li>Choose <span class="csguide-menu-option">Dictionary</span> from the <span class="csguide-menu">Spell</span> sub-menu (on the <span class="csguide-menu">Extra</span> menu) to help find the correct spelling.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="attheend" id="attheend"></a>
  <h2>Checking spelling</h2>

  <p>You may prefer to check spelling at the end of an editing session:</p>

  <p>If your document contains many proper names or highly technical vocabulary which is unlikely to be in the standard Fireworkz dictionary.</p>

  <p>If you don't want your writing or train of thoughts to be interrupted by the spelling checker.</p>

  <p>To check the spelling in your whole document:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Display the <span class="csguide-menu">Extra</span> menu and then the <span class="csguide-menu">Spell</span> sub-menu.</li>

    <li>Choose <span class="csguide-option">Check</span>. The spelling checker dialogue box will appear if there are any mistakes.</li>

    <li>Any mistakes picked up by the spelling checker will appear in the box at the top of the <span class="csguide-dbox">Spelling</span> dialogue box. Fireworkz will try to guess the correct word and the guesses will appear in the box.</li>

    <li>You can replace the mistake with a word Fireworkz suggests by clicking on the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace</span> button. There may be more than one suggested replacement, so you should pick the appropriate one.</li>

    <li>If you see that the mistake is a typing error and Fireworkz' suggested replacement is plainly wrong, delete the mistake in the dialogue box, type in the replacement and click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Replace</span> button.</li>

    <li>If the word flagged was not incorrectly spelt, but a word unknown to the dictionary, either click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Add</span> button to add it to the user dictionary, or the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Next</span> button to skip the word and search for the next incorrect or unknown word.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You don't have to check your whole document; you can check a selected area, by selecting it and then choosing <span class="csguide-option">Check</span> from the <span class="csguide-menu">Spell</span> sub-menu.</p>

  <a name="adding" id="adding"></a>
  <h2>Adding words to the dictionary</h2>

  <p>The dictionaries held inside Fireworkz are divided into four separate sub-dictionaries. they are stored as the following:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>RISC&nbsp;OS</td>
      <td>Windows</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>!Fireworkz.Resource.Dicts.Master</td>
      <td>%ProgramFiles%\Colton Fireworkz\System\UK\Dicts\Master</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>!Fireworkz.Resource.Dicts.MasterC</td>
      <td>%ProgramFiles%\Colton Fireworkz\System\UK\Dicts\MasterC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Choices:Fireworkz.Dicts.User</td>
      <td>%USERPROFILE%\Application&nbsp;Data\Colton&nbsp;Software\Fireworkz\Dicts\User</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Choices:Fireworkz.Dicts.UserC</td>
      <td>%USERPROFILE%\Application&nbsp;Data\Colton&nbsp;Software\Fireworkz\Dicts\UserC</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Master and User contain words which can be spelt in upper-case or lower-case; MasterC and UserC contain words which must have an initial capital.</p>

  <p>The dictionaries Master and MasterC are Fireworkz' own dictionary and will not be changed. Any words you add will be added to User, or to UserC if the word has an initial capital.</p>

  <p>You can add words to the user dictionary using either of the spelling dialogue boxes. To add words using the Dictionary box.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Type the word you want to add into the space in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Dictionary</span> dialogue box</li>

    <li>Click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Add</span> button in the dialogue box.</li>

    <li>The word will be added to the dictionary.</li>
  </ol>

  <a name="browsing" id="browsing"></a>
  <h2>Browsing through the dictionary</h2>

  <p>You can browse through the dictionary without using it to check spelling. To do this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Choose <span class="csguide-menu-option">Dictionary</span> from the <span class="csguide-menu">Spell</span> menu (on the <span class="csguide-menu">Extra</span> menu).</li>

    <li>Click in the <span class="csguide-option">Word</span> box.</li>

    <li>Type in the word you want to find.</li>

    <li>If it is included in the dictionary, it will appear in the list box. You can use the arrows to scroll through the dictionary to look at similarly spelt words.</li>

    <li>If your word is not found and you want to add it to your personal dictionary, click the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Add</span> button.</li>
  </ol>
