  <p>One of the most important options which you need to defined for  every worksheet is the page size and printable area. This will ensure that you can print it correctly.</p>

  <p>The end result of most documents which you create will be a printed document. In order to ensure that all your documents print out correctly first time on your printer, without text being lost off the edge of pages, you should read the following sections.</p>

  <p>If the page and margin sizes that Fireworkz uses on-screen do not match those of your printer driver, you may have problems when you try to print your document.</p>

  <p>The simplest way to ensure that your document and printer driver match is to use the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Read printer</span> option in the <span class="csguide-dbox">Paper</span> dialogue box. This matches the printable area shown on screen with the printable area produced by your printer. In effect, it makes it impossible for you to format your pages incorrectly. If you know your document is always going to be printed on the same printer, you should use this for maximum accuracy.</p>

  <p>However, the <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Read printer</span> option will only be accurate if your printer driver has been set up carefully. Remember to refer to your operating system and specific printer documentation.</p>

  <p>The key thing to remember is that if you attempt to print a document at full size on a piece of paper smaller than that it has been designed for, or using a printer which can only print a smaller area, you will not get the full page on the piece of paper.</p>

  <p>If you find that you are getting page feed or line feed problems (such as extra blank pages), it is most likely that your printer driver has the wrong page length set. Try reducing the page length in your printer driver, if that is possible, then click on <span class="csguide-dbox-button">Read</span> printer again in Fireworkz.</p>
